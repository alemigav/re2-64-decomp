"""Apply exact string replacements, and **fail loudly** when a replacement would do nothing.

Three times in one arc a scripted edit silently did nothing: `str.replace` returns the input unchanged when the
anchor is not found, the file is written back identical, and the commit message describes a change that is not
there. Two of those were handover edits — the document the project says to start from — and one was a dispatch
table, so the flag parsed and was never called.

The rule this tool enforces: an edit either matches exactly and is verified, or the run fails and **no file is
written**. It is atomic across all edits, because "the first two applied, the third did not" is the least
recoverable outcome.

Spec, as JSON on stdin or `--spec FILE`:

    {"edits": [
      {"file": "docs/handover.md", "old": "…", "new": "…"},
      {"file": "tools/x.py", "old": "…", "new": "…", "count": 3}
    ]}

`count` is the required number of occurrences (default: exactly 1). Ambiguity is a failure, not a coin flip.

Usage:
  ./patch_text.py --self-test
  cat spec.json | ./patch_text.py
  ./patch_text.py --spec spec.json
