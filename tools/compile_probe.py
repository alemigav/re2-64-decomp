"""The compile-probe corpus: which compiler profile reproduces this cartridge's code generation?

The matching roadmap's stage 4 asks one question before any function is translated: *what produced these
bytes?* This runs a small corpus of C snippets through every available compiler profile, compares the emitted
`.text` with the image, and — because a wrong C guess and a wrong compiler look identical in a byte diff —
carries a **codegen census** that fingerprints the image independently of any C.

Two things this file proved on its first run, both of which changed the plan:

  * **IDO 5.3 and IDO 7.1 are byte-identical** on every probe (`cc -O2 -non_shared -mips2 -G {0,8}`). They are
    not two hypotheses, they are one, and carrying both doubled the work for nothing.
  * **Neither reproduces the cartridge's move idiom.** For `int f(int a){return a;}` IDO emits
    `or v0,a0,zero` (`0x00801025`). The cartridge's own code contains `addu rd,rs,zero` **8 501** times and
    `or rd,rs,zero` **zero** times. That is not a C-writing problem — a move is the least ambiguous C in the
    language — it is a code-generator difference, and it **refutes IDO** for this target. `addu`-for-move is
    the GNU MIPS toolchain's idiom (the official SDK's `mipse-ultra-gcc`), which is the next candidate.

Why the byte diff alone cannot settle it, and is kept anyway: an object file holds **relocations**, not
addresses, so any probe that touches a global or a call differs from the image by construction. Probe 3
demonstrates that (`lui t6,0x0` against the image's `lui v0,0x8013`) and is reported as `relocated`, not as a
mismatch. The corpus therefore earns its keep on self-contained code, and the census carries the argument.

Two defects in *this* toolchain build are known and are not the C's fault, so they are named here rather
than debugged again every time a probe looks wrong: (a) **`as` must be given `-mcpu=r4300`** -- without it
binutils 2.7 does not set `cop_interlocks` and inserts a hazard `nop` after every `mtc1`, which costs one
recovered function 71 words; (b) **`cc1` writes every constant-pool FP literal as 0** (a 16-byte-union
`bcopy` of `CONST_DOUBLE_LOW` on a 64-bit host), so a float in `.rodata` cannot be compared at all -- only
the `.text` that loads it. Both are recorded in M260.

Usage:
  ./compile_probe.py --check     # run the corpus and the census
  ./compile_probe.py --list      # the probes and what class each one covers

# a word field and the bytes inside it must be **one union member** (sibling `u8` fields let gcc prove the byte reads
# disjoint from the word store and re-schedule the whole body: 136 of 167), the fields written with `lhu`/`sh` must be
# **`u16` with an explicit `(s16)` cast** only in the predicates (declaring them `s16` costs 7 words), and a compound
# test must be **nested `if`s** rather than `&&` because the pointer assignment between them is what stops the symbol
# address from being kept live across the branch (a flat chain costs 10 words in that arm). There is no pool literal
# in it at all -- every constant is `lui`/`ori` or an immediate -- so the pool pathologies of p6/p8 cannot arise here.

# The widest dispatch recovered so far: 206 words, bound **12**, index `lbu 6(ctx)`, twelve arms from 32 words down
# to 9, and a shared 5-word tail. It is the state machine that runs *immediately before* 0x80059868 in the same
# module -- its last word is 0x80059864 and the other function starts at 0x80059868 -- so they share the `Ctx` layout
# and the device idiom, and this one's source reuses them. Three facts are pinned by single words here: a negative
# constant stored into a `u16` field must arrive as a *signed* value (`addiu rt,zero,-800`, not `ori rt,zero,0xfce0`),
# two structurally identical clamps in one function need **opposite** comparisons (`blez` here, `bgez` eight cases
# later), and a `* k` is visible in the shamt of the `sll` feeding its `addu` (this function's is `* 5`, its
# neighbour's `* 3`).

# as a **ternary** reproduces `bltz … slti … beqzl` where an if/else-if gets the first branch inverted; a **truncation**
# `(u8)x` is not a mask `x & 0xff` (cc1 reuses a live `li v0,255` and emits `and rd,rs,v0`); two separate `slti`s mean
# **nested ifs** rather than a folded range test; and a switch phi landing in `a0` rather than `t0` is the signal that
