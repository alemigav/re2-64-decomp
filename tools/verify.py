"""The verifier's entry point. One run, one verdict, and one rule it does not get to reinterpret.

The rule: **a result is only admissible if the gates that produced it have been shown to fail.** In this
repository that is `tools/audit_gates.py` — every check's mechanism is disabled in a throw-away copy and the
check must then fail. If the audit reports any vacuous or broken entry, then whatever else passed did so for
reasons nobody has established, and the verdict is `INCONCLUSIVE` **no matter how green everything else is**.
That is deliberately not a judgement call: it is the first branch of `adjudicate`, and `--self-test` proves
each branch by feeding it synthetic results.

So the verifier does not decide whether an artefact is correct, and it does not invent a procedure. It runs
the procedures the project already maintains, in a fixed order, and reports what they said:

    tools/ci.sh              acceptance (expected case counts), tracked artefacts, cartridge digest
    tools/ratchet.py         the registry has not drifted and src/ has not moved, silently
    tools/counts.py          the seven numbers quoted in four files still agree with the registry
    tools/audit_gates.py     every gate still fails when its own mechanism is disabled  <- admission

The first three are *evidence*. The fourth is *admissibility*, and it runs last so that it is graded against
the tree as it actually is at the end of the run.

  ./verify.py               # human-readable report
  ./verify.py --json        # the same, machine-readable, for the primary agent to read
