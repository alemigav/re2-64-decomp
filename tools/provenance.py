"""Pointer provenance, layer 1: what an address is, inside one function.

The two scanners this project already has answer a narrower question than the one that keeps being asked.
`find_readers.py` computes an address when it is **built in the same function** (`lui` + `ori`/`addiu`);
`xref_registry.py` adds pointers stored into globals and reloaded. Between them they cannot see a pointer
that spends the night in a **stack slot**, arrives as an **argument**, or comes back as a **return value**
— which is exactly where the four hand-composed-address incidents lived (M84/M86/M87/M94).

This file is step 1 of experiment B (`docs/format_notes.md`, "Experiments B and C: scoped, not done"): the
intra-procedural dataflow, and nothing else. Specifically:

  * an abstract value per register and per stack slot — `const(addr)`, `param(k)`, `ret(fn)`, `load`, `unk`;
  * a real **CFG per function** with a merge at every join (a value survives a join only if every predecessor
    agrees), because a linear scan that ignores branches is the unsoundness that produced 167 false
    near-misses (M95);
  * **invalidate on loads**: a loaded register is `load`, never a stale constant — the same rule that bug
    violated;
  * caller-saved clobber across `jal`/`jalr`, and `v0 = ret(target)` recorded but **deliberately not
    resolved**: cross-function resolution is step 2 and is forbidden until this fixture is 10/10.

The fixture is synthetic MIPS with hand-computed answers, in the spirit of `test_harness.py`: each case is a
mistake this project actually made, or a merge rule that a linear scan would get wrong.

Usage:
  ./provenance.py --self-test
  ./provenance.py --target 0x800eb260 [--window 0x10]     # accesses to a window, with their abstract base
  ./provenance.py --census [--json manifests/provenance.json]
