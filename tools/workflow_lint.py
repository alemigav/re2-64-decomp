"""Lint the workflow files that define CI. CI cannot test the file that makes CI run.

M128 committed `.github/workflows/acceptance.yml` and M130 rewrote its header; both times the file was
**invalid YAML** — `run: printf 'ROM present: %s\\n' ...` has an unquoted `: ` inside a plain scalar — so
GitHub rejected it with "Invalid workflow file" and never scheduled a single run. Nothing in this repo
noticed for two milestones, because the only thing that could have noticed is the workflow itself.

No YAML library is available on a runner (the tooling is stdlib-only by policy), so this checks the
failure modes that actually bite rather than pretending to be a parser:

  1. every file declares `name:`, `on:` and `jobs:` at column 0;
  2. no plain scalar value contains `: ` — the defect above, which breaks the file outright;
  3. every `uses:` pins a ref (`@v4` or a version/SHA), never a floating branch;
  4. every job declares `runs-on` and `timeout-minutes` (a wedged job would otherwise hold the slot);
  5. every job's steps eventually run the repository gates — `tools/ci.sh` or `tools/acceptance.py`;
  6. `permissions:` is declared, tightened to `contents: read` (nothing here writes to the repo);
  7. when a job is `self-hosted`, it is gated by a repository variable (or it queues while the machine is
     asleep) and it fails when the cartridge suites were skipped (or it re-runs the hosted tier and passes).

Checks 1-6 run against the real files; `--self-test` runs synthetic ones, including a copy of the exact
line that was broken, so the linter is shown to fail on the thing it was written for.

Usage:
  ./workflow_lint.py               # self-test (5) + repository (6)
  ./workflow_lint.py --self-test   # the synthetic fixtures only
