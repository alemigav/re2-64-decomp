"""A ratchet on the gate registry: the tree must match the baseline, and decreases need a louder flag.

The reason this exists is the project's most common defect, which is not a wrong claim but a **gate that
could not fail**: six audit environments missing a directory, two mutations that failed for the wrong
reason, a `4 852 vs 4 761` miscount read as a missing class when it was 126 aliased entries. A verifier
that owns the gates inherits that failure mode in a new form — it can make its own suite pass by lowering
an expected count, by deleting a suite, or by editing the output it is supposed to check. Each is a
one-line edit and none looks like cheating in a diff.

Three invariants, all mechanical:

  match     `tools/acceptance.py` must register exactly the suites the baseline records, with exactly the
            recorded expected counts. Any difference — added, deleted, raised **or** lowered — fails, so
            a change is never silent. Accepting it is `--write`, which shows up as a diff.
  decrease  `--write` refuses to lower a count, or to drop a suite, unless `--allow-decrease` is passed.
            So the ordinary path cannot shrink the suite; shrinking it is a second, explicit act.
  src       the hash of the whole `src/` tree must equal the baseline's. A verifier may add cases; it may
            not touch the decompiled corpus to make them pass.

**The ratchet must itself be shown to fail, or it becomes the next gate that cannot fail.** `--check` on a
healthy repository passes whether or not these comparisons are wired, so `--self-test` breaks each
invariant on a synthetic root and requires detection.

That self-test found three defects in this file while it was being written, and all three are the same
class the tool exists to prevent:

1. `importlib` may serve a cached `.pyc`, so the ratchet could read a **stale registry** and report
   "monotone" about counts it never looked at. It now compiles the source text directly.
2. The src case was **vacuous**: it ran while the registry was still dirty from the previous case, so it
   failed for the *other* reason and would have passed with the src comparison removed entirely. Every
   case now restores the tree to its baselined state first.
3. A **raised** count passed `--check` silently, so "requires `--write`" was never enforced.

  ./ratchet.py --check                       # the three invariants against fixtures/gates/ratchet.json
  ./ratchet.py --write                       # re-baseline (counts and the src/ tree) — a deliberate act
  ./ratchet.py --write --allow-decrease      # ...and the only way a count may go down
  ./ratchet.py --self-test                   # prove each invariant detects its own violation
