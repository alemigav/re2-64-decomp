"""Lockstep differential of tools/mips_harness.py against Unicorn (QEMU TCG).

Unicorn is an independent MIPS32 implementation, which is the only way to ask
"is my CPU still wrong?" without the self-built harness adjudicating itself.

Two host details had to be established first, both found by experiment:

  * Unicorn's MIPS32 core translates KSEG0/KSEG1 **PCs** to physical addresses, so
    executing at 0x80000000+ needs the image mapped at the physical mirror too
    (0x00000000 for kseg0, 0x10000000 for the cartridge at kseg1). Without the
    mirror every fetch fails with UC_ERR_FETCH_UNMAPPED even though mem_map and
    mem_write succeeded.
  * Single-stepping uses a code hook that stops on the SECOND fetch, so exactly one
    instruction executes per emu_start.

KNOWN CONVENTION DIFFERENCE: around a branch/jump the two report different next PCs.
This harness tracks the delay slot explicitly (after `jal` it reports the delay-slot
address), while Unicorn reports the branch target and executes the delay slot in its own
mechanism. A raw PC-by-PC comparison therefore diverges at the first `jal` — that is a
modelling difference, not a semantic bug, and the comparison must be normalised (compare
the visited-PC sequence, or align on non-delay boundaries) before real divergences can be
found. That normalisation is the next step; this script deliberately stops at the raw
comparison and reports it honestly instead of hiding it.
