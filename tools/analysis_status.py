"""Assign every function an analysis status, derived rather than declared.

The corpus publishes one number ("3 638 functions") that says how much was *indexed*, and the strategic plan's
point is that this is not how much is *understood*. This tool publishes five, each with a rule that can be
checked rather than a feeling:

    ladder  F0 indexed       present in manifests/code_index.json (image + address identity)
            F1 decompiled    its src/<image>/<name>.c exists and the provider marked the body written
            F2 understood    every call target in its body resolves to a known function
    axes    named            its name comes from config/symbols.tsv, i.e. not FUN_/func_
            validated        a gate or an executed experiment pins its behaviour — a curated list, each
                             entry naming its evidence, never inferred

The ladder is cumulative (F2 implies F1 implies F0) because those are three degrees of the same evidence:
indexed, decompiled, mechanically connected. **Naming and validation are separate axes, not rungs** — the
strategic plan is explicit that name, types and behaviour carry separate confidence, and the data proves it:
the functions this project has *executed* are mostly still called `FUN_…`, because the rule here is that a name
needs evidence and nobody has spent the evidence on a name yet. Collapsing those into one number would have
hidden exactly that. So the residue is published two ways: how many functions still have an unresolved call,
and how many are validated by a gate yet unnamed.

Usage:
  ./analysis_status.py --write    # manifests/analysis_status.json
  ./analysis_status.py --check    # the level rules and their monotonicity (committed artifacts only)
