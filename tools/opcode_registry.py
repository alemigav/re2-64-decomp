"""M211: the derived opcode registry — one record per stage-2 opcode, and what it is allowed to claim.

`fixtures/scd/registry.json` answers one question per opcode: **where does this handler send the command
pointer, and on what evidence?** It gathers what until now lived in four different places —

  * the published advance and the control-flow class (`fixtures/scd/profile.json`, status ok|jump|dynamic);
  * the name and its provenance (`fixtures/scd/opcodes.json` = the MIT-licensed PlayStation table,
    `fixtures/scd/inferred_names.json` = read out of these handlers by this project, `measured` reserved for
    a name this project established by measurement — no opcode uses it yet);
  * the handler address, and the advance `tools/walk_stream.py` measures with its forward dataflow;
  * how the handler actually writes `ctx+0x1c`, re-read from the handler's own instructions or from its
    decompiled body wherever the dataflow and the code disagree;
  * whether the corpus contains the handler at all. 82 of the 138 distinct handler addresses are not inside
    any Ghidra function body in `fixtures/decomp/ranges.json`, so no `src/stage2/FUN_<handler>.c` exists for
    them. `in_function_body` says which, and `evidence` follows it: `"walk_stream.resolve"` where the corpus
    has a body, `"walk_stream.resolve (bytes)"` where the advance can only have come from the image, and a
    `path:line` citation only where the body was actually read.

It **refuses** to claim four things, and each refusal is enforced by `--check`:

  * **that a folded constant is a constant.** `walk_stream.advance_set` is a linear forward dataflow with no
    path sensitivity, so for opcodes `0x0d` and `0x1b` it reports `[6, 12]`. The truth is one constant path
    — 6, the fall-through into the loop body (`0x8006de50 addiu a3,a3,6` -> `0x8006de80 sw a3,28(t2)`) — and
    one *variable* path, `cmd + s16[cmd+2] + 6`, the loop-exit skip (`lh t0,2(a3)` -> `addu` -> `addiu +6` ->
    `sw`). The `12` is the scan carrying `a3 = cmd+6` across the two mutually exclusive branch arms
    (`0x8006de30 beq v0,zero,0x8006dea4`), so nothing ever advances by 12. The folded shape in its C form is
    `src/stage2/FUN_8006d5dc.c:22`, `*(uint *)(param_1 + 0x1c) = iVar2 + (uint)uVar1;` — a pointer set from a
    loaded value, which is why the registry stores `{"kind": "variable"}` for such a path and no value at all.
  * **a length for the six `dynamic` opcodes.** Their profile length is null, so `published` is null: the
    number would be invented, and the handler's destination is a saved pointer or a table entry.
  * **anything about the scheduler.** Every `scheduler_effect` is `"unknown"`; the key exists so M212 can fill
    it without changing the schema (or invalidating this tool's `--check`).
  * **a name where none is known.** An unnamed opcode keeps `name: null` and `name_source: null`; an inferred
    name is attributed to `inferred_names.json` and never inherits the PlayStation table's authority.

Two further conventions. A `constant` entry carries a number and nothing else. A `variable` entry carries the
expression that computes the pointer, the address of the `sw ...,0x1c(...)` it was read from, and the source
line it was inferred from — the decompiled body where one exists, otherwise the line in `tools/walk_stream.py`
or `fixtures/scd/inferred_names.json` that already recorded the same instructions. And `published` is the
*profile's* number, not this tool's measurement: where it is not one of the handler's own constant advances
(`0x07`, `0x13`, `0x17`, `0x18`) the registry says so instead of manufacturing a constant to match.

Usage:
  ./opcode_registry.py --write      # regenerate fixtures/scd/registry.json from the inputs
  ./opcode_registry.py --check      # validate the committed registry against the inputs
