"""Render the project's progress as a block map, and keep the README's copy honest.

Two panels, both derived from fixtures rather than drawn by hand:

  * **the cartridge**, one row per image, one cell per group of functions. The shading is the *matching* question --
    a cell is bright only when a function in it has been reproduced from the disassembly and recompiled to the
    byte. Everything else is the pseudocode corpus: present, but not yet evidence that we know what produced it.
  * **the record**, one bar per phase, read from the README's own phase table, so the picture cannot drift from the
    table beside it.

Why generated: this project's whole claim is that no number in the docs is a habit. A hand-drawn chart is a habit
with better typography. `--check` fails if the README's block differs from what this produces, exactly like
`counts.py` and `milestone_index.py` do for the numbers.

Usage:
  ./progress_map.py --write     # regenerate the block in README.md
  ./progress_map.py --check     # fail if it is stale (run by the gate suite)
  ./progress_map.py             # print to stdout
