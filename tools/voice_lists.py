"""The per-scene voice lists are in the image, and the rate bit proves they index the clip bank.

M233 established that `0x59 XaOn` passes a `u16` to the boot helper `0x80004a6c`, which indexes a table at
`DAT_8011a718`, reads a clip id out of it, and picks **8 kHz or 16 kHz from bit 15** before starting a voice.
It also recorded why the mapping was refused there: `DAT_8011a718` is **zero in the image** and written at run
time. That refusal was too pessimistic. `FUN_8017b530` writes a literal, and it points at a table that is very
much in the image:

    0x80119de0   16 pointers  ->  u16 arrays from 0x80115440
    0x80119e00    8 pointers  ->  the last seven of the same arrays

`FUN_800762b0` picks the bank with the **sign bit of `0x800e110c`** and the array with `DAT_800e8ca8 + 1`,
which is why the base looked empty: the *arrays* are static, only the selection is dynamic.

The arrays are clip lists, and the evidence is not a resemblance:

  * **654** entries across **16** distinct arrays, lengths **14..72**;
  * **8** are `0` — a skipped slot, the sentinel shape `snd_macros` records for its own tables;
  * **38** carry bit `0x8000`, and masking it leaves an index below **588**, the size of the MORT bank;
  * and **every one of the 654 resolves to a clip whose own declared rate is the one bit 15 asks for** —
    `0` mismatches, 38 at 8 000 Hz and 616 at 16 000 Hz, against `u16@+6` in each MORT record.

So the chain closes, and it was three milestones long: **`0x59 XaOn(byte, idx)` → `list[bank][idx]` → clip
(with the rate from bit 15) → the MORT record → the transcribed PCM.** The command's own byte stays dead, as
M233 measured.

What is **not** claimed: which scene uses which list (that turns on `DAT_800e8ca8`, a run-time index whose
values — 0, 2 and 0x1c are written elsewhere — are not a room number this project has established), whether
"scene" means "room", and what a clip sounds like. The backlog's **48** does not appear here either: the
lengths are 14..72 with 22, 52 and 60 repeated, and 48 is absent from the histogram.
