"""Decode the `01 41` container: a 16-byte-per-unit prologue and a payload.

The family is 355 corpus blocks whose first word is `0x01410000`. What is **proven** about them, on every block:

    word0 = 0x01410000                      magic, constant across all 355
    word1 = N                               number of 16-byte units before the payload
    word2 = filesize - 16*N                 the payload length
    word3 = 0                               (always, in this family)

so the payload begins at `16*N`, and the header is `16*N` bytes — 16 for N=1 (238 blocks), 32 for N=2 (40), 48
for N=3 (11), up to 464 for N=29. The relation holds for **355 of 355** blocks across **21 distinct N**.

What is **refuted**: that the units are a section table. Entries 1..N-1 carry arbitrary data-like words
(`0x35f23763`, `0xd24b5bff`, `0xffc00000`) rather than ascending in-bounds offsets, in every block checked. So
this is a flat prologue, and what the extra units *contain* is unresolved — a palette or mask table is the
plausible reading, and it is stated as a candidate, not a finding.
