"""The macro command space: four opcodes on a key's class tag, and no opcode byte anywhere.

WP1 (`tools/snd_proj.py`) ended with `command_streams: 0` and pointed at the `SND_POOL` side. This is
that side, and the answer is narrower and better than "decode all macros". The command space is **not a
bytecode**: an operation is selected by the top two bits of a 16-bit key — the same `(key >> 14) & 3`
tag `tools/snd_proj.py` measures as a *storage class* — and the "program" is an array of fixed-size
elements in a pool record's payload, run by `FUN_800a6820` and `FUN_800a64c8`. There is no opcode byte
and no variable-length element in the whole family; that is a negative, and it is the negative that
makes the positive usable.

    opcode          payload                              reader -> what it requests
    0x0000 key      class-0 record, 24..128 B            FUN_800b185c -> FUN_800ad998: one voice on
                    = 3..16 eight-byte elements          that sample record
    0x4000 key      128 x 8-byte entries                 FUN_800adf54: entry[selector & 0x7f] ->
                                                          another key, and the dispatcher re-enters
    0x8000 key      {u32 count} + count x 12-byte rows   FUN_800adfb4 -> FUN_800a64c8: run the rows in
                                                          order, one voice per live row
    0xc000 key      8 B = 4 little-endian u16            FUN_800afbfc: a level ramp on an existing
                                                          voice; the note dispatcher REFUSES it

The dispatch is three branches and a refusal, all in one function, and that is what makes four rows
defensible rather than invented: `FUN_800a6820` masks `key & 0xc000` and handles `0x4000`, `0x8000` and
`0`, returning `-1` for `0xc000`. Each row in `commands` names the `src/` witness it rests on, and
`--check` re-reads those witnesses — a row whose code moves is a failing row, not a stale claim.

What this artefact refuses:

  * **no opcode field inside an element.** All 981 live rows of the 12-byte sequences perform the same
    request (one voice) and differ only in operands; `+9..+11` are zero on all 1 315 rows. Calling a row
    byte an opcode would be inventing the thing WP1 went looking for. The four opcodes live one level
    *up*, in the key, and the sequence's own element vocabulary is one operation plus a skip marker.
  * **0xffff is a skip, not a terminator.** The loop bound is the explicit count at `record + 8`; the
    `*puVar1 != 0xffff` test guards the body. The last element is `0xffff` on 327/327 arrays, but 7 of
    the 334 sentinels sit *inside* an array and carry non-zero bytes in their remaining ten — so the
    structure is a count-prefixed array with a hole marker, and this artefact does not model it as a
    C string.
  * **no name for the class-0 payload's interior.** The payload is an 8-byte element array of 3..16
    elements (the reader computes `payload + param_8 * 8`), but nothing in the corpus reads an element's
    fields at a named offset, so the fields are `unresolved` and are not tabulated.
  * **no reading of the class-3 ramp's curve** — `FUN_800adef4` is called from `FUN_800afbfc` with its
    argument dropped by the decompiler, so which field selects the interpolation table is open.
  * **no claim that the tag bits are a "type" in the cartridge's vocabulary.** `0x4000`/`0x8000`/`0xc000`
    are published as the values the dispatcher branches on, which is all the code says.

One correction to WP1, made here because the counts below depend on it and not because WP1 is this
tool's business: **a section's first record starts AT the section offset**, not one stride past it. The
u32 at the section start is the first record's own stride — the same shape `SND_PROJ` has, where record 0
is at offset 0. Read the other way, each section leaves a gap exactly one record wide (112 / 16 / 1032 /
60 bytes), and the four keys the walk then skips are precisely the four values WP1 published as
`unresolved` (`531`, `0xc085`, `0x4001`, `0x8098`). With the base corrected the counts are 2026 / 242 /
4 / 327 = 2 599 records, and **every one of the 7 388 `SND_PROJ` list values resolves** — lists 0, 2, 3
and 4 are bijections onto the four pool classes. `tools/snd_proj.py` is unmodified; see `sections` below
for the measurement, which `--check` re-runs.
