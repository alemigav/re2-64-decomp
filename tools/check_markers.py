"""Assert that the documents still contain the sections they are supposed to contain.

M131 built `tools/patch_text.py` so a scripted edit cannot silently do nothing. That fixes the *write*. It does
not fix the *check*: after an edit, the only thing that noticed a missing section was a human grepping for the
heading — and twice it did not notice at all. `docs/handover.md` lost two entire sections ("How green is
enforced" and "An external reference worth knowing about") that were written, committed, and absent from the file
through four commits, because `str.replace` wrote the input back unchanged and nobody looked.

This closes that loop. It knows a short list of anchors that must exist, and one structural rule — every
`docs/log/*.md` the milestone table points at must exist — so a dangling reference or a vanished section fails a
check instead of waiting to be re-read.

Design notes:

* the anchors are **literal strings**, not headings parsed as markdown: a heading whose text drifted is exactly
  the failure this is for, and parsing would be a second thing that can be wrong;
* failures name the file and the missing anchor, so the fix is obvious without opening the tool;
* `--self-test` covers the tool itself (missing marker, missing file, dangling reference, complete set), and the
  repository is checked by running it with no arguments.

Usage:
  ./check_markers.py             # check this repository
  ./check_markers.py --list      # show what is required, and why
  ./check_markers.py --self-test
