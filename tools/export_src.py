"""Project the decompiler's journals into a committed, readable source tree.

The authoritative output stays in `build/decomp/<image>/` (gitignored, resumable, journaled).
This step is a projection, not a second source of truth: it rewrites `src/<image>/` from
`decompile-index.json` every run, so the committed tree can never drift from the journal.

Per-function file names come from our own seed list where one exists (config/symbols.tsv ->
build/seeds/<image>.tsv), otherwise from the provider's name (FUN_xxxxxxxx). Every file carries
a provenance header: load address, image base, body range, body size, and the body's sha256.

Callees are derived here, not taken from the index — the index carries no call edges. The
derivation is a direct scan of the image bytes for `jal`, which is exact for direct calls and
blind to indirect ones (M27 showed the message sends are indirect, so absence of an edge here
is not absence of a call).

Coverage is reported per image: the union of function body ranges against the image extent,
plus every code byte no function claims. Those gaps are where data lives inside a code image.

Usage:
  ./export_src.py --images build/elfs/images.json --decomp build/decomp --src src
