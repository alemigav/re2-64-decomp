"""Put the walk path in the gate: build a synthetic RDRAM, walk it, and check what came out.

The walk in `walk_stream.py` needs a memory dump, and the project has none to commit — an RDRAM image is
8 MiB and, more to the point, any real one is derived from the cartridge. So this fixture **builds** the
dump instead of committing it: eight megabytes of zeroes with five short command streams planted in it, one
per context, each exercising a different branch of the decoder.

The dump is written to a temporary directory, never to the repository.

Cases, one per behaviour that used to be exercised only by hand:

  1. the walk starts where `ctx+0x1c` points;
  2. `Goto` computes its target from `s16@4` and prints the derivation;
  3. `Goto` is actually **followed** — the next command is at the target, not the fall-through;
  4. `ElseStart` prints both successors and takes the **fall-through**;
  5. a `dynamic` opcode (`0x03`, a script jump) stops the walk and says why;
  6. an `unverified` opcode (`0x40`) stops the walk instead of guessing a length;
  7. the `SceEmSet` command prints its `Id` field (byte 3) — the operand M94 measured.

Usage:
  ./rdram_fixture.py            # run the fixture
  ./rdram_fixture.py --keep DIR # also leave the built dump in DIR for inspection
