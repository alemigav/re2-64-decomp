"""Report every instruction that accesses an address window, with its enclosing function.

This is the question that has been asked four times in this project in four different shapes — who
writes `0x800ca458`, who writes the two staging banks, who reads `0x800eb264`, who selects the scene
slot — and each time it was answered with a fresh ad-hoc script whose arithmetic could be wrong.
`vaddr.py` fixed the arithmetic; this fixes the shape.

The scan is a forward abstract pass per image: `lui` opens a high half, `ori`/`addiu` (signed) close
it, `addu`/`or` of two knowns combine, `li` produces a small constant, and any other write to a
register clears it. A memory instruction whose base register holds a known constant is then a
computable address, and it is reported with the *enclosing function* — found by scanning back for a
prologue, and cross-checked against the corpus index when one exists.

What it does **not** do: track a base that came from memory. Those accesses are counted separately,
because "the pointer was loaded" is exactly the case where this analysis cannot see the address and
a count is more honest than silence.

Usage:
  ./find_readers.py 0x800eb260 0x800eb270         # a window
  ./find_readers.py 0x800eb268                    # a single word
