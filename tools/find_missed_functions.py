"""Find functions the provider did not split, from the bytes it left unclaimed.

A decompiled corpus reports what it claimed; the interesting part is what it left over. Stage-2
had 243 unclaimed runs, and one of them (0x8009d014) turned out to contain a prologue followed by
a scaled-index `jr v0` dispatch — a real function, reached by an indirect call, which the
provider's call-graph-driven discovery never created.

This tool turns that observation into a repeatable pass. For each image it takes the function
bodies the provider claimed, computes the complement, and looks for *prologue-led code* inside it:

    a candidate is emitted only when
      * the word is `addiu sp,sp,-N` (a frame setup), and
      * it sits inside a run the provider left unclaimed, and
      * that run also carries call/return evidence (>= 3 `jal`, or >= 2 `jr ra`)

The third condition is what separates a missed function from data that happens to contain a
prologue-shaped word: over the whole cartridge, `jal`-shaped data words are common (the census
found members with 510 of them and no returns), but a run with real returns and real calls is code.

Candidates are emitted as *boundaries*, not names: `func_<address>`. A boundary is a claim about
structure and is checkable by re-running the export; a name is a claim about meaning and needs the
evidence rules in config/symbols.tsv.

Usage:
  ./find_missed_functions.py --images build/elfs/images.json --decomp build/decomp \
      --out manifests/missed_functions.json --seeds build/seeds_extra
