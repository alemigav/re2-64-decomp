"""The cartridge file table: a census, and the format of the two files that were "unidentified".

`cart_record(0x43)` is `0xb00c8624` (M146): a `0x28`-byte header whose first word is a count, then
`count` 8-byte `{offset, size}` entries relative to cart `0xC8624`. Every milestone since M146 treated
that table as a **zlib manifest**, because the files it was first used on are zlib members.

It is not. It is the whole file system, and most of it is stored **raw**:

    entries                 8091     113 exact sentinels (offset 0xFFFFFFFF, size 0)
    real                    7978     4852 begin `68 DE` and inflate, 3126 do not (58 270 043 B)
    4852 ->                4726     distinct offsets; 126 entries are repeats over 67 shared offsets
    walked members          4761     4726 from this table + 35 that live in the boot descriptor table

The 3 126 non-zlib entries are the media, stored uncompressed — their heads are `ffd8ffe0` x1257
(JPEG) and `000001b3` x271 (MPEG-1), which reproduces M9's independently carved counts.

That reframes the 17.6 MB. It is not a region between files:

    id 1983   cart 0x0b73fbc..0x140ed7c   9 022 912 B   (was "R3", M9 bounds are 9 B / 8 B looser)
    id 1979   cart 0x0338fea..0x0b630fe   8 560 916 B   (was "R4")
    sum                                   17 583 828 B

Both are named by the sound init (`FUN_800759d8`) beside three files it tags on the way in —
`SND_PROJ` (0x7bc), `SND_POOL` (0x7bd), `SND_SMPDIR` (0x7be) — and those three are exactly the entries
that tile the space between them (ids 1980-1982). The sound family is ids 1979-1983, contiguous in cart
order, and the whole 17.6 MB belongs to it.

id 1979's own format is decoded here. `FUN_800b3f54` consumes `[u32 count][count x u32]`, and the file
is that, followed by `count` records:

    header   u32 count = 588, then 588 x u32 `0x01000000 | offset`
             first offset == 4 + 4*count (the table's own end); 587/587 ascending; 588/588 in range
    record   `MORT` u16 field u16 rate u16 0      (10-byte header, then payload)
             magic MORT 588/588, rate in {16000, 8000} 588/588, +8 == 0 588/588

Three things are deliberately *not* claimed:

* `u16` at +4 is **unassigned**. It is not the record length (`len == 32*field` holds 0/588), and no
  constant header size makes the payload a multiple of 16 or 9 — so "16-byte VAG frames" is refuted for
  this container, not confirmed.
* `MORT` is a literal tag with no assigned meaning. It is the ASCII at every record start, and nothing
  more is known.
* Whether id 1983 is audio at all is **inferred** from the call site, not proven. Its head reads as
  small signed 16-bit values and its mean entropy (7.169) differs from id 1979's (7.925), but no code
  reading of a parser exists yet.

The N64-Tools claim that RE2's table is `[flag][u24 addr]` at cart `0x2C794` is checked and **refuted**
here: that span holds 2 577 words whose first byte takes no flag distribution at all, and whose
`(u24 < romsize)` test cannot fail for any 64 MB cartridge.
