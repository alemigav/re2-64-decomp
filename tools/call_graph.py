"""Publish the corpus's call graph — every edge carrying the evidence that produced it, and no edge
whose target nothing in the corpus can name.

The corpus already states its direct calls: `manifests/code_index.json` lists `callees` per function.
What it does not state is *how* each callee was found, what the code does where it finds none, and
what the addresses it cannot resolve are. This tool publishes that, per call site:

    kind              `jal`; `tail` (a `j`, or a `jr` through a constant, that leaves the body);
                      `jalr-resolved` (a register call traced to one constant); `table-dispatch` (a
                      call or tail dispatch through a jump table); `callback` (a function address
                      stored into memory)
    confidence        1.0  a directly decoded transfer to a corpus function (`jal`, or `j` leaving
                           the body)
                      0.9  a register target that traces to a `lui`+`addiu` constant
                      0.8  a function address stored into memory — a static function pointer
                      0.7  one member of a dispatch table with an authoritative bound
                      0.5  decoded, but the target is not a corpus function, or no claimed body owns
                           the site — the target is known and the *edge* is not
                      0.0  the target is not statically determined: `dst` is null and `why` names
                           what was in the way (a table base, a memory slot, an unwritten register)
    tables            each base a dispatch site indexes, with its bound and where the bound came from

Four things it refuses, because each one would be a guess:

  1. **A bound nobody declared.** A table walked until its entries stop looking like code is a value
     scan, and M173 already showed that walk running to 46 entries where the class table holds 14
     (`tools/routine_index.py`). Only two sources may bound a table here: the 31 bases whose lengths
     `routine_index.py` checks against the image gate by gate, and the `declared_cases` a dispatcher
     states with its own `sltiu`/`slti` guard (`manifests/jump_tables.json`). Every other base is
     recorded with `bound: null`, and its sites carry `dst: null` — 302 sites name a base instead of
     a target rather than inventing fourteen.
  2. **A `jr`-indexed table treated as a call.** A `lw` + `jr` switch jumps to case blocks *inside*
     the dispatching function: 189 of the 240 such tables have no entry that leaves the body at all.
     Where an entry does leave the body it is recorded, and nowhere else.
  3. **An edge with no owner.** A call site no claimed body covers is `src: null` at 0.5. It is kept —
     a call from unclaimed bytes to a real function is evidence that the corpus is missing a function
     — but attributing it to a neighbour by proximity would be invention.
  4. **A target rounded to the nearest function.** A `jal` whose target is not a function start stays
     a bare address at 0.5 (158 sites). It is never snapped forward or back.

Node identity is `image:address`, not address. 3 638 functions hold 3 487 distinct addresses: 28
overlays load at `0x80161cf0` and 112 addresses name more than one function, so an address-keyed
graph would merge 151 functions' edges. Table keys are image-qualified for the same reason: 15 of the
516 traced base addresses are shared by two or three overlays (`0x80166608` by three), so a bare
`addr` key would hand one overlay's bound and entries to another's dispatch site.

Nothing is stored as a count. Degree, per-image totals and edges-per-kind are derivable, so they live
in `--write`'s output and in `--check`'s labels, never in the file. A call target is a function
*start*, not an address inside a function: `code_index.callees` follows that rule and `--check` holds
this artefact to it exactly — for every node, the addresses its `jal` edges reach must equal its
`callees`, or the case names the node.

A body is its claimed ranges, not `addr..addr+size`: 22 functions have a gap in the middle, and a
scan of `size` bytes from the start then reads a neighbour's `jal` and reports a callee the provider
never had. Reading the ranges is what makes the `jal` reconciliation exact.

Usage:
  ./call_graph.py --write    # manifests/call_graph.json
  ./call_graph.py --check    # identity, edge shape, the callees reconciliation, table bounds, size
