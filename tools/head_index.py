"""What the dispatch heads dispatch on — the index expression, traced to its source.

`dispatch_heads.py` (M228) found 86 heads and said of them only that they dispatch through a table. The
obvious next question is what the index *is*, because it decides what each head is a dispatch over: a byte of
the script command stream, a field of a structure the CPU filled, a caller's argument, or a global. This tool
answers it per head with a **bounded** trace — bounded on purpose, because a window is not an attribution
(M212, M227, M229) and the honest report is `unknown` rather than a guess.

For each head it takes the `sltiu` that bounds the index, follows the register it tests backwards through
shift/mask/add/move and one load, and reports:

  * **the transform**, in order — `srl 8`, `andi 0xff`, `addiu -1` — because a 1-based sub-opcode and a
    zero-based one are different interfaces;
  * **the source**, classified as one of `command_field` (a load at a fixed offset from the command pointer the
    CPU publishes at ctx+0x1c), `ctx_field` (a load at a fixed offset from another base held in an incoming
    argument), `global` (a load through a `lui`-built absolute address), `argument` (an incoming argument
    register, used as an index directly), `local` (computed from registers this bounded trace cannot resolve),
    or `unknown` (defined before the head's own code, so the trace refuses);
  * **the offset and the width**, so `0x36`'s `u16[cmd+4] >> 8` and a `u8[cmd+1]` are distinguishable.

The classification is deliberately narrow. A `lbu v1,-28100(v0)` whose `v0` is not resolved in the window is
**not** reported as a global just because the displacement is large: it is `unknown`, and the count of those is
published so the reader can see how much of the answer is missing.
