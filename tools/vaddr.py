"""Resolve a virtual address to the image that actually contains it — and refuse to guess.

Three of this project's last four wrong numbers came from the same place: an ad-hoc command
composing an address by hand.

  1. `lui 0x800c` + `addiu -23464` composed as `ori`, giving `0x800ca458` instead of `0x800ba458`
     — the case tables looked empty and a runtime writer was hunted for two sessions;
  2. `lw v0,-19868(0x800f0000)` composed as `+ 0xb264`, giving `0x800fb264` instead of
     `0x800eb264` — where a valid pointer had been sitting all along;
  3. `0x80004550` read out of the *stage-2* image, when it lives in the **boot bank** (the negative
     offset silently sliced from the wrong end of the buffer).

All three are one mistake: the address was computed in the head instead of by a tool that knows the
address space. So this tool does three things and refuses to do a fourth:

  * `sext16(imm)` and `compose(hi, imm, mode)` make the sign explicit — `mode` is `add` or `or`, and
    there is no default, because the default is what went wrong;
  * `locate(vaddr)` returns every image whose load range contains the address **plus** the offset in
    that image's bytes, and raises when more than one image matches unless the caller names one
    (twenty overlays share `0x80161cf0`, so a bare address genuinely does not identify an image);
  * `read(vaddr, n)` reads through `locate`, so the offset is never typed by hand.

Usage:
  ./vaddr.py 0x80004550            # which image, what offset, first words
  ./vaddr.py --self-test           # the three historical mistakes, as assertions
