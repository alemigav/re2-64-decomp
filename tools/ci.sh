# Three checks, in the order that fails fastest and most informatively:
#   1. every fixture, via tools/acceptance.py (same suite the pre-commit hook runs)
#   2. nothing that must stay out of git is tracked (ROM, extracted assets, builds, binaries)
#   3. the cartridge, when present, still hashes to the value the manifests were built from
#
# The cartridge is gitignored by design, so a fresh clone cannot supply it: check 3 reports SKIP and the
# cartridge-dependent suites in check 1 report SKIP too. CI is therefore meaningful without the ROM —
# 30 of 71 suites, 277 of 990 cases — and strictly stronger with it. Exit status is non-zero on any real
# failure. Both figures are asserted by `tools/counts.py`, which is why they are written on one line.
