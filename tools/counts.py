"""Derive the suite/case counts from the registry, and assert every place the docs quote them.

Six numbers describe the gate suite — total suites, total cases, the runnable pair and the
cartridge-gated pair — plus the audit suite's own case count, which is the seventh and the one that
actually drifted (26 → 30 → 35 → 37 across three milestones). They are quoted in four files, in eight
different phrasings. Until now each milestone re-derived them by hand and edited every site, which cost
three propagation errors in one arc: `273` left in the README after the suite grew, `129` written where
the gated total was `133`, and `177` where the runnable tier was `178`.

So they are derived once, here, from `tools/acceptance.py` — the same list `acceptance.py` runs — and
every quoting site is checked against them.

The subtlety that makes this more than a grep: **a phrase that disappears must fail.** A gate that only
compares numbers passes silently when the line it was checking is deleted, which is this project's
signature defect in its purest form. Every check therefore requires its pattern to be present exactly
the expected number of times, and a missing phrase is a failure, not a skip.

  ./counts.py --check        # every quoting site agrees with the registry
  ./counts.py --derive       # just print the seven numbers
  ./counts.py --self-test    # a wrong number fails, and a deleted phrase fails
