# M4 — ROM structure without disassembly

2026-10-30. Tool: `tools/scan_banks.py` (byte-level, 2.2 s for the whole ROM, no Ghidra).

## Code region: now confirmed by three independent methods

| Method | Says code ends around |
|---|---|
| splat segment analysis (M2) | ROM `0x12140` |
| Ghidra function bodies (M2 partial) | within the same window |
| byte fingerprints — `jr ra` + `addiu sp,sp,-N` density | top blocks all ≤ ROM `0xF000`, nothing above `0x12000` scores |

Three unrelated techniques agreeing is the strongest boundary statement the project has.

## The ROM is banked — proven

Histogram of every in-range pointer (`0x80000000–0x803FFFFFF`) in the cartridge:

```
total in-range pointers: 30,687      distinct 64 KB buckets: 64
span: 0x80000000 .. 0x803F0000        (= the full 4 MB of RDRAM)
most common: 0x80000000 (4,401)  0x80070000 (907)  0x80060000 (723)  0x800F0000 (665)
             0x80300000 (657)   0x803A0000 (626)   0x801D0000 (619)
```

Pointers reach every 64 KB of RDRAM. A flat single-image layout cannot produce that:
the game loads code/data to many VRAM bases. **The boot bank — the only part analysed so
far — is the 0x80000000 cluster.**

## Pointer tables found

Seven runs of ≥8 consecutive pointers, all clustered immediately *after* the code end:

| ROM offset | entries | target range |
|---|---|---|
| `0x000128B8` | 84 | 0x8000F618 – 0x8000FA58 |
| `0x00012490` | 16 | 0x80004DCC – 0x80004E98 |
| `0x00012310` | 14 | 0x80003220 – 0x800036D0 |
| `0x000133B0` | 11 | 0x80011870 – 0x800118E8 |
| `0x000121D8` | 10 | 0x8000174C – 0x80002158 |
| `0x00012238` | 10 | 0x80002474 – 0x80002A68 |
| `0x000124F0` | 9 | 0x800009C4 – 0x80000C68 |

Every target lies inside the boot bank, so these are **function/data pointer tables**, not
load descriptors. They sit in a tight 4 KB cluster right after the code — likely the
game's own tables for initialisation.

## What did not work

A scan for adjacent `(rom_offset, vram)` record pairs — the naive shape of a load table —
found **zero** runs of ≥5 records. So the mapping is not stored as plain pairs. Options
remaining: a packed/compressed table, per-entry file IDs resolved through code, or a
structure with a header the naive scan cannot see.

## Next step

Read the 84-entry table at ROM `0x128B8` by hand (it is the largest and densest), and
identify the loader routine in the boot bank that consumes it. That is the shortest path
to converting 67 MB of `bin` into VRAM-anchored segments.
