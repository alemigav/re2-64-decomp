# Resident Evil 2 (N64) — decompilation research

**What it is:** a black-box study of *Resident Evil 2* on the Nintendo 64 (`NREE` rev 1 USA), reverse-engineered
from the cartridge up — 3 416 functions catalogued, the file formats decoded, the script virtual machine and three
audio codecs worked out from the bytes, and **94 functions reconstructed in C and recompiled — 93 of them matching
the game's own machine code byte for byte**. It ships a **1055-case verification suite**, and every claim here is
either measured by one of those cases or explicitly labelled a reading of the code.

| | |
|---|---|
| **The result** | The compiler that built this game is **identified and reproduced** — gcc 2.8.1 for MIPS-ELF — and **93 functions now match the cartridge exactly**, down to the last byte — from Nintendo's own libultra runtime down to single-instruction accessors, including **59 that come from eight shared bodies**, so one proven shape registers every copy |
| **The unusual part** | **286 checks run with no ROM, no assets and no emulator** — the other 769 need your dump and say `SKIP`, never `PASS` — plus a verifier that refuses to report `PASS` unless it has first proved each gate *can* fail |
| **The scale of what is left** | 62.2 % of the image bytes sit inside a known function body and the other 37.8 % is classified rather than guessed; finishing 64 MB is a community-scale effort, so every stage ships as it lands |

**This is not a matching build** — of the whole cartridge. But that sentence is no longer the only thing the
project can say about the matching question: the compiler that produced this game has been **identified and
reproduced**, and whole functions are now reconstructed from the image and recompiled **to the byte** (see
[The matching build](#the-matching-build)). Finishing 64 MB is still a community-scale effort, so the project
stays staged to be useful at every step: formats decoded, a full pseudocode corpus, the script VM, the texture
container, the audio filesystem, and a gate that refuses to let a number rot — plus a verifier that will not
report `PASS` unless the gates themselves have been shown to fail.

## Who this is for

Reverse-engineering researchers, decompilation enthusiasts, and anyone who wants to see how a 1999 N64 cartridge
is actually put together — the deep technical detail is in [docs/](docs/handover.md) and
[the milestone log](docs/MILESTONES.md), and none of it is required to run the checks.

## Quick start — 60 seconds, no cartridge

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alemigav/re2-64-decomp
cd re2-64-decomp
python3 tools/verify.py          # -> PASS-FAST: 286 cases run, 769 SKIP (they need your dump, never PASS)
```

That is the whole setup: Python 3, no dependencies, no cartridge. To go deeper without the ROM, run
`python3 tools/acceptance.py` for the suite by name, or `python3 tools/verify.py --full` to add the mutation audit
(every gate is re-run with its mechanism disabled and must fail). With a dump of your own, see
[Rebuild with your own dump](#rebuild-with-your-own-dump).

## Project highlights

- **The compiler, pinned** — gcc 2.8.1 + binutils 2.7 reproduce this game's code, and **93 functions now match
  byte for byte**, 59 of them from eight duplicate-body cohorts ([The matching build](#the-matching-build))
- **Formats decoded** — the script VM (141 handlers, 18 instruction lengths), the T64 texture container, three
  audio codecs including one reimplemented to **sample-for-sample** parity ([What is decoded](#what-is-decoded))
- **286 of 1 022 verification cases need no ROM** — the rest SKIP without a dump — and 146 *mutation* audits prove
  each gate can fail
- **A generated progress map** — coverage per image, re-derived and gated on every run, never hand-drawn
- **Every number has a measurement** — the docs are asserted against the registry by `tools/counts.py`, and a
  claim without a case is labelled a reading

## Proof, in bytes

One of the 15: `osCreateMesgQueue`, nine instructions of Nintendo's runtime, at `0x80006d30`. Here is what the
cartridge holds and what this repository's C compiles to — same nine words, 36 of 36 bytes:

```
cartridge   3c028001 24422940 ac820000 ac820004 ac800008 ac80000c ac860010 03e00008 ac850014
this repo   3c028001 24422940 ac820000 ac820004 ac800008 ac80000c ac860010 03e00008 ac850014
            ^ lui v0,0x8001 / addiu v0,v0,0x2940 (&__osThreadTail) ... jr ra / sw a1,0x14(a0) in the delay slot
```

A case in the suite compiles that C and asserts the 36 bytes; the other fourteen have the same shape, and the
one that does not yet match is published as **226 of 229 words** rather than rounded up
([the map](#progress-map) shows which).

## The jargon, in one line each

| term | meaning here |
|---|---|
| **image** | one loadable block of the cartridge — `boot`, `stage2`, or one of 34 overlays; 36 in total |
| **byte-exact** | our C compiles to the *same bytes* as the game's own object code, not merely equivalent behaviour |
| **splat** | a splitter that proposes code/data boundaries; here it proposes and the census disposes (M2, M207) |
| **Ghidra** | the decompiler that produces the starting pseudocode; every `FUN_…` body in `src/` comes from it |
| **REA** | the local tooling that drives Ghidra/rizin over these images and captures the results reproducibly |

## No ROM, no assets, no affiliation

The cartridge is **not in this repository and never will be** — not in the tree, not in any of its 200+
commits. `rom/`, `assets/` and `build/` are gitignored; the only `.z64` here is an 8 KiB *synthetic* fixture
that exists so the corpus pipeline can run without the game.

You need your own legally dumped copy to run anything that reads the cartridge. Nothing extracted from it —
no textures, no audio, no video, no compressed members — is committed. Only its SHA-256 is, in
`manifests/manifest.json`.

## What this project produced

* **The mapping law**: `vram = rom_offset + 0x7FFFF480`, established three independent ways after the first
  version of it was wrong by `0x480` and had invalidated every address (M7).
* **The container**: 4 761 zlib members, 8 748 242 → 18 550 424 B, plus 1 227 MJPEG frames and 271 MPEG-1
  blocks, all verified byte-for-byte (M9/M10).
* **The code corpus**: **36 images** (boot + stage-2 + 34 overlays, 1 947 632 B) censused from the cart's own
  load table, **3 416 functions** over **3 678** ranges, **62.2 %** of the **1 947 632** image bytes inside
  a known body (**1 211 256 B**) — `src/`, `src/INDEX.md`. The other 37.8 % is classified, not shrugged at
  (M207): **407 608 B padding**, **6 640 B** data the decompiler names, **964 B** of jump tables, and
  **321 820 B (16.5 %) unclassified** — a bucket that is published and never renamed `data` on a hunch.
  The function count excludes the **174 switch case bodies** the provider itself labels `switchD_::caseD_`:
  they are code, they are counted in the 3 678 ranges and in the byte total, but they are reachable only
  through the table their owner dispatches on, so they are kept under `src/<image>/switch/` instead of being
  published as functions (M288).
* **What is actually understood** (M209, derived by `tools/analysis_status.py`): of **3 416 functions**,
  **3 329** resolve every call target in their bodies, **33** carry a curated name, and **12** have behaviour
  pinned by a gate or an executed experiment — and all **12** of those are still called `FUN_…`, because a
  name needs evidence of its own.
* **The script VM**: a 141-entry handler table, **18 distinct instruction lengths** from 1 to 40 bytes
  (M136 published 15; the 30- and 38-byte sizes arrived when M141 corrected `0x69 ItemAotSet4p` and `0x2d
  ObjModelSet` against the PS1 table — M210),
  decoded from the handlers' own behaviour rather than from a reference (M136–M156).
* **Room population**: 256 table entries → 147 ids → 50 room scripts, proven before anything was modelled
  on it (M156–M158).
* **The texture container (T64)**: palette plus raw indices, no compression, `len = 16 + entries·2 + w·h·bpp/8`
  verified on **65 of 65** tiles (M159–M167).
* **The exception path**: `break` → vector → dispatch loop `0x8000098c`, with no `eret` and no EPC write —
  fatal, only a hardware reset leaves it (M168–M171).
* **The audio filesystem**: the file table is the whole file system, not a zlib manifest — 8 091 entries, of
  which **3 126 are stored raw** — and the 17.6 MB "unidentified" region is five files: a 588-record `MORT`
  voice bank, three chained section tables, and a sample pool of **1 192 samples that tile it to the byte**
  (M178–M193).
* **The sample codec, decoded**: order-2 ADPCM with a **256**-byte shared codebook, with **217 944** of
  **217 944** groups structurally valid and **1 180** of **1 192** samples decoding to audio (median
  adjacent correlation +0.901). `tools/sound_decode.py` implements it and gates the result (M187–M193).
  The other twelve are **not failures**: adjacent correlation runs continuously from +0.44 to +0.98 with no
  gap, and the low tail is noise-like content — a 0.7 line drawn through a smooth distribution (M194).
* **Two codecs, not one**: `id 1979`'s 588 records are *not* that format — high-entropy, 16 000/8 000 Hz,
  and no raw prelude — so the voice bank and the sample pool are encoded differently (M189/M191).
* **The voice codec, decoded and bit-exact**: `id 1979`'s 588 `MORT` records are a second, unrelated
  codec — LSB-first bits inside big-endian words, 160 samples per block in 260-bit frames, 14 % of blocks
  silent — and the whole synthesis (dequantisation, a pitch predictor, an 8-stage lattice, a four-band
  polyphase mix) is reimplemented in Python and graded **sample for sample** against the cartridge's own
  code: 13 clips, 634 blocks, 0 differing (M195–M199). `tools/voice_decode.py` also writes the audio.
* **A verification system that can be checked without the game**: 48 mutation audits, a ratchet that forbids
  silent count changes and any edit to `src/`, derived-and-asserted documentation numbers, and one entry point
  that treats a dirty gate audit as `INCONCLUSIVE` rather than `PASS` (M179–M183).

## Verify it without the cartridge

This is the part that is unusual for a decompilation, and the part you can check in a minute. No ROM, no
assets, no emulator:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alemigav/re2-64-decomp && cd re2-64-decomp
python3 tools/acceptance.py      # 32 suites / 286 of 1055 cases run; the other 41 suites SKIP
python3 tools/audit_gates.py     # 146/146 — every gate must fail when its mechanism is disabled
python3 tools/workflow_lint.py   # 14/14 — CI lints the file that makes CI run
python3 tools/check_markers.py   # 22/22 — every doc anchor, heading and note pointer holds
python3 tools/artefact_scan.py   # 5/5  — no tracked file is cartridge content
python3 tools/ratchet.py --check # the registry has not drifted, and src/ has not moved, silently
python3 tools/counts.py --check  # the numbers quoted here still agree with the registry
python3 tools/verify.py          # all of the above, adjudicated into one verdict
```

The suites that need the cartridge print `SKIP (needs the cartridge)` — **never PASS**. A suite that cannot
run and reports success is the same error as a test that asserts nothing, so the split is stated everywhere
it is counted: **769 of 1055 cases cannot run without your dump**, and the CI job summary lists them by name.

Two things worth knowing about how the gate works:

* `tools/audit_gates.py` **disables each check's mechanism** and requires the check to fail. 146 mechanisms,
  146 failures, **0 vacuous**, and the unmutated tool is run first as a positive control: an audit whose
  sandbox cannot run the tool is reported **BROKEN**, not passed. That control found that **49 of 132** audits
  had never tested their mutation — the sandbox had no `manifests/` — so the earlier `127/127` was inflated.
  It has repeatedly caught checks that could not fail: its own environment assumptions, a verdict rule that
  made five audits green unconditionally because it grepped the output for the word `FAIL`, and two
  mutations that were provably no-ops on this image.
* `tools/ratchet.py` forbids the three silent edits that make a suite pass: lowering an expected count,
  deleting a suite, or editing `src/` to satisfy a check. Every change needs `--write`, which is a diff.
* `tools/counts.py` derives every number quoted in this file and the handover from the registry and asserts
  them in sixteen places. A phrase that *disappears* is a failure, so deleting a stale line cannot help.
* `tools/milestone_index.py --check` regenerates [the milestone index](docs/MILESTONES.md) and fails if it
  drifts from the log. The index cannot be hand-edited into agreement with anything.

## Milestones

**317** numbers, 0-316: **261** with a row, and **56** named gaps. The full index — every number, its title,
and the note behind it — is [docs/MILESTONES.md](docs/MILESTONES.md); the narrative record is
[docs/reverse_engineering_log.md](docs/reverse_engineering_log.md), which also carries a retraction table
worth reading before you believe any older note.

| phase | range | what happened |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | M0–M9 | toolchain proof, dump identification, code/data split, the mapping law, cart table, unpack |
| P1 | M10–M30 | media container recovered, five stride hypotheses killed, load path, first CPU/CP0/FPU model |
| P2 | **M31–M78** | **the unsaved middle** — no notes survive; only M48, M51 and M78 as commit subjects |
| P3 | M79–M80 | interrupts work end to end; the boundary is *work*, not signalling |
| P4 | M81–M110 | code corpus (3 416 functions plus 174 switch case bodies), bank-C loader chain, scripted emulator control, scene-slot path closed as by design |
| P5 | M111–M125 | pointer provenance, and two external references assessed |
| P6 | M126–M135 | the gate itself: fixtures, hook, CI, synthetic corpus, marker checks |
| P7 | M136–M156 | the script VM decoded — lengths, licensed names, jump family, room population |
| P8 | M157–M172 | populations audited; `0x0141`, T64, handle registry, exception path; consolidation |
| P9 | M173–M177 | index bounds, a CI that actually runs, and publication readiness |
| P10 | M178–M191 | the file table is the file system; the 17.6 MB is the audio family, framed end to end; the sample codec identified and its fields confirmed; the two key holes resolved |
| P11 | M192–M199 | the pool codec decoded and its samples audible; the voice bank's stream recovered from the reader's own bit order; the voice synthesis transcribed and verified sample for sample; the gate suite made fast enough to run every turn |
| P12 | M200–M210 | the pool record's classes pinned from the data; two published corpus figures corrected (coverage was a word high, `covered_bytes` was a word count), and the landing unit becomes a cycle |
| P13 | M211–M222 | the script VM's opcode registry, a call graph whose edges carry evidence, verification split into tiers, `TYRANT` named as a codename, and the three work packages that closed the sound family |
| P14 | M223–M230 | the RSP microcode decoded and deliberately not named; the interface read as a frame loop; the vector unit named 252 of 254; the dispatch-head queue resolved |
| P15 | M231–M250 | **the toolchain identified**: the sound backlog closed, a verification prototype (warm quarter-second), splat's rehearsal on the boot image, binutils 2.7 and IDO built natively, IDO refuted by a move census, gcc 2.7.2 then **gcc 2.8.1** reproducing every probe |
| P16 | **M251–M300** | **whole functions reproduced from the image**: the compile-probe corpus, sixteen functions recovered (`0x8004fd1c`, `0x80057e1c`, `0x80024558`, `0x80070120`, `0x80059868`, `0x80059530`, `0x800acae4`, `0x8007e590`, `0x800701d8`, `0x8006fc5c`, `0x8006ff48`, `0x8006e68c`, `0x8006e574`, `0x800704e0`, `0x80006d30`, `0x8000cc90`), **fifteen byte-exact** — all fifteen are in the map, because the recovered-function fixture put their measured extents into the index (M289) — and the build facts that made it possible — `-mcpu=r4300` on both compiler and assembler, `-g` on the assembler so it stops swapping branches with the preceding instruction, the FP constant pool's values and placement, the aliasing rule that decides instruction order, and — from **M300** — the permuter harness in `fixtures/permuter/p6/`, whose own objective turned out to be a compiled proxy rather than the image |
| P17 | **M301–M307** | **the duplicate-body cohorts**: 148 of the 3 400 unmatched functions have a body that is byte-identical to another's, in 48 groups — so **one proven reconstruction registers every copy**. Three cohorts banked: **34** copies of the empty function (`jr ra; nop`), **11** of a nine-word masked call, **3** of a four-word sequential store setter whose last store fills the `jr` delay slot — all **48 byte-exact**, taking the total to **64 recovered / 63 exact** (M307). Earlier in the arc: the README's front door and a byte-for-byte proof block (M301), the permuter re-pointed at the image instead of a compiled proxy, which closed a function M255–M257 spent three milestones on and **retracted M300's conclusion** (M302), the shape-vs-allocation boundary measured on `osCreateThread` (M303), and the case-4 select register decoded as a real live-range conflict that no source shape and no `cc1` variant tried can move (M304–M306) |

The gap at M31–M78 is stated rather than reconstructed: writing a note from guesswork would be
indistinguishable from one written from measurement, and that distinction is the project's whole claim.

## The matching build

The question that decides whether a decompilation can ever be byte-exact is *what produced these bytes*. It is now
answered, and answered by measurement rather than by reading:

- **Compiler:** gcc **2.8.1** for `mips-elf`, at `-O2 -G 0 -mips2` — four of four probe functions byte-identical,
  including a linked probe that gcc 2.7.2 cannot reproduce.
- **Assembler:** binutils **2.7**, which expands `move` to `addu` natively — the cartridge's own idiom, where
  modern gas picks `or`.
- **The assembler needs `-g`, and it is not about debug info:** gas's own `mips_optimize` defaults to 2, and at that
  level it fills a branch's delay slot by swapping the branch with the preceding instruction (`tc-mips.c`). `-g` sets
  it to 0. Across the whole image **not one of the 2 237 `jr ra`** has a load in its delay slot, so the original build
  assembled with the swap off — which is invisible until a function has a `load; return` arm, and then it is 41 words.
- **The cpu flag matters:** `-mcpu=r4300` on **both** the compiler and the assembler. On the compiler it selects
  the load's `READY-DELAY` (2 instead of 3) and therefore the instruction order; on the assembler it stops a hazard
  `nop` being inserted after every `mtc1`.
- **Two patched compiler behaviours**, both forced by evidence about the image rather than convenience: its constant
  pool holds the real IEEE bits, and its `.rodata` is `[jump table][constant pool]` with every float constant
  loaded from memory — a scan of the whole image finds no `li.s` expansion anywhere.

With that profile, fourteen functions have been reconstructed from the disassembly and recompiled:

| function | size | result |
|---|---|---|
| `0x8004fd1c` | 98 words | **byte-exact** (only alignment padding past the image's extent) |
| `0x80057e1c` | 84 words | **byte-exact, zero differences** |
| `0x80024558` | 139 words | **byte-exact** — it needed two toolchain facts rather than source work: the original gives every **double** constant its own pool slot and shares its **float** ones (M291), and it never splits a **float** address, so the assembler materialises it with `$at` (M292) |
| `0x80070120` | 46 words | **byte-exact**, jump table included — a predicate dispatcher over `==`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` and `&` |
| `0x80059868` | 167 words | **byte-exact**, jump table included — a seven-state game-state machine touching the device window |
| `0x80059530` | 206 words | **byte-exact**, jump table included — the largest and the widest dispatch yet, twelve arms, the state machine that runs immediately before the one above |
| `0x800acae4` | 53 words | **byte-exact**, jump table included — a clamp-then-dispatch predicate, the first target dispatching on an offset domain (`(cmd & 0xff) - 128`) |
| `0x800704e0` | 123 words | **byte-exact**, jump table included — the third member of the accessor family: each of 44 arms returns `p + offset`, and ten also bump a `u16` counter at `0x80115120`, sharing one increment tail through a `j` |
| `0x8006e68c` | 41 words | **byte-exact**, jump table included — a seven-operator predicate dispatcher (the same operator set as `0x80070120`), and the leaf that `0x8006e6b8`'s embedded dispatch actually belongs to |
| `0x8000cc90` | 24 words | **byte-exact** — `osSetEventMesg`, and the revision marker: Nintendo's later source carries an `OS_EVENT_PRENMI` block this image does not, and removing exactly that block reproduces it (M297) |
| `0x80006d30` | 9 words | **byte-exact** — `osCreateMesgQueue`, and the first **library** function recovered: Nintendo's libultra C compiled by this pipeline reproduces the image's nine instructions exactly, which is what says RE2's runtime was rebuilt from libultra source with this compiler (M296) |
| `0x8006e574` | 23 words | **byte-exact** — a bit-test leaf (`(word & (0x80000000 >> (b & 31))) != 0` XOR `(c == 0)`), exact once the table pointer is the *first* addend and the offset is written as a shift (`<< 2`) rather than a multiply |
| `0x8006ff48` | 98 words | **byte-exact**, jump table included — the write half of the accessor pair whose read half is `0x800701d8`: same 44 indices, same offsets, one store per arm, and only 2 words per arm because the store rides in the `jr ra` slot |
| `0x8006fc5c` | 53 words | **byte-exact**, jump table included — the smallest member of the arm-shaped family, a seven-way dispatch writing a halfword into `base + a * 376`, with its case bodies in the image's order 2, 3, 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 |
| `0x800701d8` | 141 words | **byte-exact**, jump table included — a 44-arm accessor dispatcher, one load and a `jr ra` per arm; it is the function that forced `-g` on the assembler (below) |
| `0x8007e590` | 229 words | 226 of 229 — the largest attempted and the only one where a *structural* choice, not a shape, was the last mile: the switch has no `default:`, so case 3 `break`s into the device-update tail while case 1 and case 4 `return` past it. The three remaining words are one register in case 4's value select (`li a0,5` where the image has `li v0,5`) |

The residues are reported, not rounded off, and three of the findings that got here were corrections of the project's
own earlier claims. `tools/compile_probe.py --check` runs the whole thing; `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` carries the build
recipes and the obstacles found by running them.

## Progress map

A picture of where the work actually stands, generated from the fixtures by `tools/progress_map.py` and checked
by the gate suite — a hand-drawn chart would be a habit with better typography. The top panel is the *matching*

## What is decoded

Formats are documented in [docs/format_notes.md](docs/format_notes.md) with the measurement behind each
claim, and codified in [include/re2_formats.h](include/re2_formats.h) with a C validator
(`tools/t64info.c`) that is compiled and run in both directions on every gate run.

| format | state |
|---|---|
| cartridge | 67 108 864 B, header entry `0x80000480`, cart table at vram `0x80012150`, 66 records + a build stamp |
| script VM | 141 handlers, **17** lengths (1–40 B), `0x44 SceEmSet` carries the enemy Id at byte 3, GoSub stride 2 |
| room population | 256 byte entries → 147 ids → 50 room scripts |
| model container | `01 41` = format version **321**, self-relative offsets relocated by `FUN_800824b8` |
| textures (T64) | `[0xBE1E][height][width][size][format][palette entries]` + RGBA5551 + raw 4/8-bpp indices |
| exception path | `break` → `jr k0` → `0x800006d0` → dispatch loop `0x8000098c`; unrecoverable by design |
| file table | 8 091 entries + build stamp; 4 852 zlib, **3 126 stored raw** — the media, uncompressed (M178) |
| sound files | ids 1979–1983: a 588-record `MORT` bank, `SND_PROJ`/`SND_POOL` chained tables, `SND_SMPDIR` |
| sample pool | id 1983, 9 022 912 B: **1 192 samples tiling it to the byte**, 15 canonical rates (M184) |
| sample codec | order-2 ADPCM: one **256**-byte shared codebook per bank, then 40-byte groups — `2 raw + 30 nibbles = 32 samples` per 20-byte frame; decoded and gated (M193) |
| voice bank header | `MORT` + u16 **block count** + u16 rate + u32 **length/4** = **12** bytes; a normal block is a fixed 260 bits (M193, corrected by M194/M197) |
| voice codec | bit stream is LSB-first inside big-endian 32-bit words; per block 36 scale bits + 4 × (17 + 39); synthesis transcribed and bit-exact (M197–M199) |
| directory record | 28 bytes, and that is the whole record: index, refcount, offset, rate, codec byte, **24-bit declared length**, **loop start**, **loop length** — the mixer adds the last two for the loop end and plays the remainder out on release (M193, corrected by M203/M204) |
| key spaces | pool keys are `[tag][index]` with the tag in the **top two bits** (`(key >> 14) & 3`); the four POOL **sections** are tagged 0, 3, 1, 2 in file order — sections are *storage*, while the roles are the **six lists** a `SND_PROJ` record carries; `SND_PROJ`'s 417 records rotate from key 118; one key is absent and one reference dangles, and they are the same fact (M188, corrected by M200) |

The 17.6 MB is no longer unidentified, and neither codec is: the pool decodes to audio, and the voice
bank's stream, its header (12 bytes) and its whole synthesis are transcribed and verified sample for
sample against the cartridge. `u16@+4` is the `MORT` clip's **block count** at 160 samples per block,
which is why every `payload/field` ratio sat under 32.5 bytes (260 bits per block). What genuinely
remains: **what the 16-byte class-3 parameter record is called** — its fields (rate, time, size, level) and its
role (the record 142 samples pair with) are measured, but the cartridge never labels it. The loop points a
directory record carries are settled (M203): **+20 is a loop start and +24 a loop length**, both in decoded
samples, and 187 of the 1 192 records name one.

## Layout

```
tools/       100 analysis and gate scripts — plain Python 3, stdlib only, nothing to compile
src/         3 416 decompiled functions across 36 images, one .c per function, provenance in each header, with the 174 switch-case bodies the provider labels `switchD_::caseD_` kept under `<image>/switch/`
docs/        handover.md (start here), format_notes.md, MILESTONES.md, reverse_engineering_log.md
docs/log/    241 notes, one per milestone that has one
manifests/   offsets, sizes, addresses, hashes — derived facts, no bytes
fixtures/    the synthetic cartridge, the opcode tables, the function-boundary index
include/     re2_formats.h — the format structures, shared by the tools and the C validator
config/      symbol map and splat configuration
```

Two documents matter most: [docs/handover.md](docs/handover.md) is written so a cold session can resume
without the transcript, and [docs/format_notes.md](docs/format_notes.md) is the reference for what the
cartridge actually contains.

## Rebuild with your own dump

Place the cartridge at `rom/re2.z64` (byte order is auto-detected), then:

```sh
python3 tools/n64info.py rom/re2.z64                          # identify and normalise the dump
python3 tools/unpack_zlib.py rom/*.z64 --out assets/unpacked  # 4 761 members, ~11 s
python3 tools/build_images.py rom/*.z64                       # 36 ELFs into build/elfs/
python3 tools/read_overlay_table.py rom/*.z64                 # the load table, self-validating
python3 tools/export_src.py                                   # build/decomp → src/
sh tools/ci.sh                                                # the whole gate, with the cartridge
```

The decompilation step itself is Ghidra 12.2 driven through REA's CLI (`rea decompile-all --provider ghidra`),
one invocation per image, seeded from `config/symbols.tsv`. It takes hours, not minutes; the chain that
matters for reproducing the *findings* is the gates, and those take a minute.

`docs/handover.md` has the full sequence, including how the ranges fixture (`fixtures/decomp/ranges.json`,
3 678 regions) stands in for the decompiler's index so a rebuild cannot silently shift a boundary.

## Legal and licence

This repository contains **no cartridge data**: no ROM bytes, no extracted assets, no audio, no video. You
need your own legally dumped copy of Resident Evil 2 (N64) to run anything that reads the cartridge.

derivative of that work and are published here for study, with no warranty of correctness and no claim of
