# Third-party material — what is whose

This repository contains one artefact transcribed from another project, one body of work that is
**nobody's to license**, and a large amount of material that is the author's own. This file separates them.

`LICENSE` (CC0-1.0) applies to the last group only.

## 0a. **Removed: the imported corpus (M356–M369)**

`fixtures/decomp/imported/` held **170 C files** taken verbatim from another *Resident Evil 2* (N64) decompilation,
`delibrete/Resident-Evil-II-Decompilation-N64`. **They were removed in M369**, and this section is the record of why.

| | |
|---|---|
| project | `delibrete/Resident-Evil-II-Decompilation-N64` (produced by the `decompdecomp` harness) |
| licence | **none published** — no `LICENSE`, `COPYING` or `NOTICE`, so by default **all rights reserved** |
| taken, then removed | the C text of **194 reconstructions**, and the 170 files under `fixtures/decomp/imported/` |
| kept | the **claims**: every one of those functions stays in the census as a measured extent — address, extent, word count — published as a **listing**, not a reconstruction |

The sequence is worth recording because the repository got it wrong twice. **M356** said that corpus is *"never
committed here"*; **M359** built a channel that committed exactly its text; **M361–M366** filled it with 194 entries;
**M366** documented the contradiction and offered three options; **M367** chose keep-and-attribute; **M369** reversed
that and removed the text. The retractions are in the notes and in the log's retraction table, because the point is not
that a decision changed but that each step is on the record.

The distinction that survives all of it: **the verification was always this project's, the C never was, and
verification is not a licence.** Every one of those 194 was byte-exact against this cartridge under this profile; that
made them *claims*, not *property*.

What remains third-party in this repository is section 2's material — the game's own code, acknowledged as Capcom's,
offered for removal on request.

## 0. Read as a specification, not copied: the sound codecs (GPL-3.0)

Two sound codecs in `fixtures/sound/codec.json`, `tools/sound_decode.py` and `tools/file_table.py` were
established with reference to **re2studio**, a Resident Evil 2 (N64) romhacking toolkit:

| | |
|---|---|
| project | `theanine3D/re2studio` — <https://github.com/theanine3D/re2studio> |
| licence | **GPL-3.0** |
| what was taken | **facts only**: the `MORT` header field order, the 28-byte directory record's fields, and the ADPCM frame/group geometry |
| what was **not** taken | no source code. `tools/sound_decode.py` is an independent Python implementation written from the format description and validated against the cartridge, not a port |

**GPL-3.0 code cannot be incorporated into a CC0-1.0 repository**, and none has been. What a program
*does* — a file layout, a bit width, a formula — is not the program, and this repository's own
measurements confirm each fact independently: the header's length field matches the clip extent on 588 of
588 records, the directory record tiles the sample pool exactly, and the decoder produces audio from the
shared codebook where a per-sample book produces noise. Those checks are what the citation rests on; the
tool is credited because it pointed at the answer, not because it is relied upon.

Its constants also corroborate three this project derived from the decompilation on its own — the voice
context stride `0x1228`, the frame-size field at `+0x166`, and the starting bit position `0x60` at
`+0x11c8`.

## 1. Transcribed: the RDT opcode table (MIT)

`fixtures/scd/opcodes.json` carries 45 opcode numbers and 46 variants — names and Playstation-side field
sizes — transcribed from the Go source of **OpenBiohazard2**, an MIT-licensed re-implementation:

| | |
|---|---|
| project | `OpenBiohazard2/OpenBiohazard2` — <https://github.com/OpenBiohazard2/OpenBiohazard2> |
| file transcribed | `fileio/rdt_scd.go` (the `SCDCommand` structs: opcode, name, and the PSX field sizes) |
| licence | MIT — <https://github.com/OpenBiohazard2/OpenBiohazard2/blob/master/LICENSE.md> |
| copyright | Copyright (c) 2020 Samuel Yuan |
| what was taken | identifiers and field sizes only. No Go code is copied, and the sizes are labelled PSX-side because that is what the reference documents |

The transcription was made because MIT permits it (M142), and the attribution travels *inside* the fixture
(`fixtures/scd/opcodes.json`, key `attribution`) rather than only in this file. Consumers:
`tools/walk_stream.py` (line 190 onward) and `include/re2_formats.h` (the comment above the opcode table).

Names this project *inferred* rather than transcribed are kept in `fixtures/scd/inferred_names.json`,
separately and deliberately: where the licensed name exists, it wins.

## 2. Neither licensed nor ours: `src/`

The 3 638 `.c` files under `src/` are **decompiled pseudocode**, generated by Ghidra 12.2 (through REA)
from the user's own cartridge image. Resident Evil 2 is a Capcom work; that pseudocode is derivative of it.
The author has no standing to license it and does not try to.

It is published here to be read: the analysis it represents, the formats it documents, and the tools that
reproduce it are the contribution. No warranty of correctness is given — the notes say, per function, how
far each claim reaches, and 37.7 % of code bytes are admittedly unclaimed.

If a rights holder objects to its presence, it will be removed on request.

## 3. The author's own, dedicated to the public domain (CC0-1.0)

* `tools/` — every analysis and gate script
* `docs/` — `format_notes.md`, `MILESTONES.md`, `handover.md`, `reverse_engineering_log.md`, `log/M*.md`
* `fixtures/decomp/ranges.json`, `fixtures/scd/{inferred_names,profile}.json`
* `fixtures/corpus/` — 8 192 bytes of **synthetic** words, not cartridge data
* `manifests/` — offsets, sizes, addresses and hashes, no bytes
* `checkpoint/` — register and trace metadata, no memory dumps
* `include/re2_formats.h`

## 4. Read but not distributed

| what | why it is not here |
|---|---|
| `n64decomp/perfect_dark` (MIT) | consulted for method; **nothing was ported** (M124 assessment in `docs/handover.md`) |
| `MeganGrass/bio2-ds` | not open source — read as a reference only, no code ever copied |
| three Nintendo SDK PDFs | copyrighted manuals, `.gitignore`d (`docs/*.pdf`); local reference only |
| the cartridge | never committed, in any commit; only its SHA-256 appears, in `manifests/manifest.json` |

## 4b. Cited as a specification: the RSP's register map and instruction tables (CC BY-SA-4.0)

Two pages of the **N64brew Wiki** supply the one thing the local Programming Manual does not: the RSP's
COP0 register numbers and the field split of the vector-unit instructions.

| | |
|---|---|
| source | N64brew Wiki, <https://n64brew.dev/> (Miraheze) |
| pages | `Reality_Signal_Processor/Interface`, revision **5376** (2024-03-19) — the register map, the length-is-bytes-minus-1 rule, the semaphore's read-sets-the-bit behaviour, the `SP_STATUS` write layout |
| | `Reality_Signal_Processor/CPU_Core`, revision **5539** (2025-02-01) — the `lwc2`/`swc2` field split and access sizes, **the vector-unit instruction tables** (computational, select, single-lane, and the element/broadcast modifier list), the single-lane lane-selection rule, the 12-bit PC, and that branch-likely opcodes are not implemented |
| licence | **CC BY-SA-4.0** — <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/> |
| what was taken | **facts only**: register numbers and their names, bit-field boundaries, opcode-to-mnemonic rows, access sizes and stated behaviour. **No text is reproduced** and no wiki markup or code is copied |
| where it appears | `tools/rsp_iface.py` (`SP_REGISTERS`) and `tools/rsp_decode.py` (`VU_ALU`, `VU_SELECT`, `VU_SINGLE`, `VU_BROADCAST`, `VU_ROWS`, `VU_FORMAT`, `VU_KIND`), with the two manifests' `external_sources` blocks carrying the URLs, revisions and licences next to the claims that use them |
| defects in the source | two, both recorded in `manifests/rsp_ucode.json` (`external_sources.table_defects`) rather than quietly worked around: the transpose group states `0x01 swv`, which collides with the scalar group's `0x01 lsv/ssv`, and the computational table has **no row for `funct 0x11`**, which this cartridge uses twice. Those two words are the whole of the artefact's `unreadable` list |

The manual was asked first and answered clearly — it does not map these registers and says so: p115, "With
the current software architecture, the application does not program the SP directly, and need not concern
itself with IMEM and DMEM accesses", and its own index lists the header it defers device bit patterns to
(`rcp.h`) against pages 110–111 only, which are the DP, VI, AI and PI status registers. So the wiki is used
because the authority is genuinely absent, and every consequence drawn from it is re-measured against the
cartridge rather than trusted: the length values the ucode writes are all bytes-1 with bytes a multiple of
8, the two transfer directions are both present and each one is the direction the cited page gives its
trigger register, and the vector transfers' corrected addresses all land inside DMEM. Those checks are what
the citation rests on. **CC BY-SA-4.0 is share-alike for the licensed text; none of it is present here**,
and the facts themselves are not copyrightable — the attribution is given because it is owed, not because
it is a licence condition on this repository's own work.

## 5. How that is enforced rather than promised

`tools/artefact_scan.py` (part of every push and every commit) reads the bytes of every tracked file and
fails if any of them carries an N64 cartridge header, hashes to the cartridge, exceeds 4 MiB, or hides under
`rom/`, `assets/`, `build/` or `docs/*.pdf`. The one exempted path is the synthetic fixture, by name, capped
at 1 MiB. `tools/ci.sh` and the pre-commit hook both run it.
