# Milestones

Every milestone this project recorded, in numeric order, with the evidence behind it.

**This file is generated** by `tools/milestone_index.py`; do not edit it by hand. `--check` fails when it
and `docs/reverse_engineering_log.md` disagree, so the two cannot drift. The *record* is that log (one line
per milestone, plus a retraction table) and `docs/log/M<n>-*.md` (one note per milestone); this is the index
to them, and the frontpage carries a curated [phase table](../README.md#milestones) over the same ground.

325 milestones are indexed. 247 of them have a note; the rest are rows in the log that cite
`docs/format_notes.md` instead. **56 have no record at all** — 24, 31–78, 80, 172, 240–244 — and they appear in place, marked
*(no row, no note)*: an index that hides its gaps is worse than one that names them. Why they are empty is
at the foot of this file.

| 83 | **M83** — the pipeline audit, and what the differential actually measures | `docs/log/M83-pipeline-audit.md` |
| 84 | **M84** — the static tables: store-runs, jump tables, and the address I had wrong | `docs/log/M84-static-tables.md` |
| 85 | **M85** — the bank-C loader: found as a call chain, with one hop still open | `docs/log/M85-bank-c-loader.md` |
| 86 | **M86** — the loader's contract, and two bugs in the instrument I was about to trust | `docs/log/M86-load-contract-and-harness-bugs.md` |
| 87 | **M87** — the harness fixed under a fixture, the slot map found, and the codec hypothesis tested | `docs/log/M87-harness-fixture-and-slot-map.md` |
| 88 | **M88** — the codec is zlib after all, and the scene slot traces to a heap object | `docs/log/M88-codec-is-zlib-and-scene-slot.md` |
| 89 | **M89** — there is no bank-C caller | `docs/log/M89-no-bank-c-caller.md` |

| 91 | **M91** — the bank-C map *is* read, and bank C is not compressed | `docs/log/M91-bank-c-map-is-read.md` |
| 92 | **M92** — one caller, the s0 direction corrected, and index 67 is a build stamp | `docs/log/M92-callers-s0-direction-and-index-67.md` |
| 93 | **M93** — the slot condition fully traced, `cart_record(0)` is a *crash* path, and the build question | `docs/log/M93-slot-condition-and-build-question.md` |
| 94 | **M94** — callers of `FUN_8003287c`, enumerated, and the slot values they pass | `docs/log/M94-callers-enumerated.md` |
| 95 | **M95** — the table at `0x80113898`: three readers, and entry 68 is selected by a byte | `docs/log/M95-table-readers-and-index-68.md` |
| 96 | **M96** — `FUN_8003287c`'s callers and their slot values, enumerated | `docs/log/M96-slot-values-enumerated.md` |
| 97 | **M97** — descriptors are script commands; no code writes their bytes 0 and 3 | `docs/log/M97-descriptors-are-script-commands.md` |
| 98 | **M98** — where the stream comes from: a runtime buffer inside the room overlay | `docs/log/M98-stream-source.md` |
| 99 | **M99** — the stride is settled: a variable-length bytecode, and opcode 0x44 is 22 bytes | `docs/log/M99-stride-settled.md` |
| 100 | **M100** — the watch is set and the probe is built; the one input needed cannot be made here | `docs/log/M100-watch-and-dump-probe.md` |
| 101 | **M101** — the room dump arrived, and it corrects the model: the loader is gated | `docs/log/M101-room-dump-and-the-gate.md` |
| 102 | **M102** — the gate PASSES, and it is vacuous for this descriptor | `docs/log/M102-the-gate-passes.md` |
| 103 | **M103** — the walk: 174 commands, no scene-slot command pending, and slot 31 selects *nothing* | `docs/log/M103-the-walk.md` |
| 104 | **M104** — no other rooms available, and the six "desyncs" are stream ends | `docs/log/M104-no-other-rooms-and-the-six-stops.md` |
| 105 | **M105** — the counter is a flag, and the first real scene-slot commands are found | `docs/log/M105-counter-is-a-flag-and-the-first-slot-commands.md` |
| 106 | **M106** — the maps never populate, and the scene-slot path is a per-execution no-op | `docs/log/M106-maps-never-populate.md` |
| 107 | **M107** — controlling ares directly (design) | `docs/log/M107-ares-control.md` |
| 108 | **M108** — the ares handshake: one byte, and then the whole machine | `docs/log/M108-ares-handshake.md` |
| 109 | **M109** — driving the game through the debugger: the transport works, the input layer doesn't | `docs/log/M109-ares-injection-attempt.md` |
| 110 | **M110** — three rooms, one operand, and the scene-slot path is by design | `docs/log/M110-three-rooms-one-operand.md` |
| 111 | **M111** — experiment B, step 1: a provenance core that survives its own fixture | `docs/log/M111-provenance-step1.md` |
| 112 | **M112** — experiment B, step 2: summaries resolve the record chain, and the map reader stays out of reach | `docs/log/M112-provenance-step2.md` |
| 113 | **M113** — `CONSTBASE`, and what acceptance test 2 actually proves | `docs/log/M113-provenance-cbase.md` |
| 114 | **M114** — jump-table edges: 4 142 new edges, and the `unreached` bucket finally moves | `docs/log/M114-provenance-jump-tables.md` |
| 115 | **M115** — the `unk` bucket: measure the cause first, then fix the one that dominates | `docs/log/M115-provenance-unk-cause.md` |
| 116 | **M116** — frame slots: entry-relative keys, and proof that `spoff` is not an unresolved bucket | `docs/log/M116-provenance-slotkeys.md` |
| 117 | **M117** — Ghidra's function bounds replace my heuristic, and two layer-2 fabrications fall out | `docs/log/M117-ghidra-bounds.md` |
| 118 | **M118** — frame slots are 98.5 % resolved; the residual is stack arguments, and the tests are now executable | `docs/log/M118-provenance-slot-misses.md` |
| 119 | **M119** — stack-argument propagation: the mechanism resolves 89.8 %, and buys seven addresses | `docs/log/M119-provenance-stack-args.md` |
| 120 | **M120** — the caller-side check: 7 sites out of 14 371, and one of them read from the instructions | `docs/log/M120-provenance-stk-check.md` |
| 121 | **M121** — reading the callee: seven confident flags, all mine | `docs/log/M121-provenance-stk-verdict.md` |
| 122 | **M122** — the register-argument check: same method, different question, and it needed four calibrations | `docs/log/M122-provenance-arg-check.md` |
| 123 | **M123** — path sensitivity clears the polymorphic sites, and what perfect_dark is actually good for | `docs/log/M123-path-sensitivity-and-perfect-dark.md` |
| 124 | **M124** — the controller layout, diffed against perfect_dark's libultra | `docs/log/M124-controller-layout-diff.md` |
| 125 | **M125** — the CHNL_ERR path, made executable | `docs/log/M125-chnl-err-made-executable.md` |
| 126 | **M126** — `pad_layout` in the acceptance suite, and a mixed-errno fixture that changed a behaviour | `docs/log/M126-acceptance-suite.md` |
| 127 | **M127** — a pre-commit hook that runs the acceptance suite | `docs/log/M127-pre-commit-hook.md` |
| 128 | **M128** — CI: the same acceptance run, locally and on a runner | `docs/log/M128-ci.md` |
| 129 | **M129** — a 9 KB synthetic cartridge, so the corpus pipeline runs in CI | `docs/log/M129-synthetic-corpus.md` |
| 130 | **M130** — can the last three checks run in CI? Two blockers, one of them removable | `docs/log/M130-corpus-checks-in-ci.md` |
| 131 | **M131** — a scripted edit now fails loudly instead of doing nothing | `docs/log/M131-loud-patches.md` |
| 132 | **M132** — the marker check: the loop M131 left open | `docs/log/M132-marker-check.md` |
| 133 | **M133** — the marker check now runs in both directions | `docs/log/M133-marker-reverse-check.md` |
| 134 | **M134** — the registration check extended to the notes themselves | `docs/log/M134-note-registration.md` |
| 135 | **M135** — being registered is not the same as being registered correctly | `docs/log/M135-index-consistency.md` |
| 136 | **M136** — the 141 handlers, mapped: every opcode advances the stream by its own N | `docs/log/M136-command-length-map.md` |
| 137 | **M137** — Phase 2 starts from a reference, and its fingerprints do not yet fire on our data | `docs/log/M137-phase2-reference-and-negative-tests.md` |
| 138 | **M138** — the registry route pays: nine 8-byte entries, the room's own entry point, and two confirmed structures | `docs/log/M138-registry-route.md` |
| 139 | **M139** — S2DEX is searchable: OCR with the OS, no installs | `docs/log/M139-s2dex-ocr.md` |
| 140 | **M140** — the enemy routine table is found; the room header is runtime data, and that closes the static route | `docs/log/M140-enemy-table-and-room-header.md` |
| 141 | **M141** — OpenBiohazard2 names the opcodes, and it breaks the "one length per opcode" claim | `docs/log/M141-openbiohazard2-names-the-opcodes.md` |
| 142 | **M142** — the licensed table is imported, the walk refuses to guess, and M141's own correction was wrong | `docs/log/M142-licensed-table-and-a-walk-that-refuses.md` |
| 143 | **M143** — the jump family decodes, and `0x32 Poset` was never missing a length, only a window | `docs/log/M143-jump-decoder-and-poset.md` |
| 144 | **M144** — `0x03` is a script jump, the advance scan becomes a dataflow, and the walk is in the gate | `docs/log/M144-script-jump-dataflow-and-walk-gate.md` |
| 145 | **M145** — all 141 opcodes classified, and the script base turns out to be a cartridge block | `docs/log/M145-all-opcodes-classified-and-the-script-base.md` |
| 146 | **M146** — the id resolves, and a real room script decodes out of the cartridge | `docs/log/M146-room-script-decoded-from-cartridge.md` |
| 147 | **M147** — the whole file table swept: 102 673 commands, every opcode seen, and the shape of a scenario | `docs/log/M147-opcode-profile.md` |
| 148 | **M148** — a dozen opcode reads, and a second naming source that cannot be confused with the first | `docs/log/M148-twelve-opcode-reads.md` |
| 149 | **M149** — the two-NOP question, and three more reads (one of them a random number generator) | `docs/log/M149-two-nops-and-three-more-reads.md` |
| 150 | **M150** — the block-return slots are modelled, the CFG walk is real, and the NOP answer flips | `docs/log/M150-block-slots-and-the-nop-answer.md` |
| 151 | **M151** — the 1 % was my own defect, the GoSub stride settles, and the dead-code list exists but is not proof | `docs/log/M151-orphans-stride-and-dead-code.md` |
| 152 | **M152** — the callback theory is refuted by the code, and the interpreter loop is now read | `docs/log/M152-callback-theory-refuted.md` |
| 153 | **M153** — both leads closed: the dead-only list falls from 8 to 2, and the stream exits were right | `docs/log/M153-both-leads-closed.md` |
| 154 | **M154** — no direct starter exists, `0x0f` was mis-sized, and a guard-order bug made my own model inert | `docs/log/M154-no-direct-starter-and-a-guard-order-bug.md` |
| 155 | **M155** — the gate audited: three checks were vacuous, and two of my audit's own mutations were too | `docs/log/M155-gate-audit.md` |
| 156 | **M156** — both leads closed, by asking a smaller question | `docs/log/M156-room-population-closes-both-leads.md` |
| 157 | **M157** — the rule applied backwards: every earlier population, audited | `docs/log/M157-population-audit-retrospective.md` |
| 158 | **M158** — the section-table hypothesis is refuted, and the room table turns out to be a resource table | `docs/log/M158-section-table-refuted-resource-table.md` |
| 159 | **M159** — the `01 41` count field is decoded: 16 bytes per unit, proven on 355 of 355 | `docs/log/M159-container-count-decoded.md` |
| 160 | **M160** — the correlation run: N is neither a bit depth nor a value count | `docs/log/M160-correlation-refutes-bit-depth.md` |
| 161 | **M161** — the display-list reading, tested and refuted | `docs/log/M161-display-list-reading-refuted.md` |
| 162 | **M162** — relational: the family is what the *model* loaders load | `docs/log/M162-relational-loader-kinds.md` |
| 163 | **M163** — the three calls read: relocation, part filter, and a tile grid of *display lists* | `docs/log/M163-three-calls-relocation-grid-display-lists.md` |
| 164 | **M164** — dumping the tile: there is no GBI in it, and M163 was wrong | `docs/log/M164-tile-dump-refutes-gbi.md` |
| 165 | **M165** — the T64 tiles decoded: no compression, a palette and raw indices | `docs/log/M165-t64-format-no-compression.md` |
| 166 | **M166** — `h1` is the true height, not a stride | `docs/log/M166-h1-is-the-height.md` |
| 167 | **M167** — palettes are not shared: the engine shares whole tiles | `docs/log/M167-palettes-not-shared.md` |
| 168 | **M168** — the handle's high byte is a global allocation counter, not a per-slot generation | `docs/log/M168-registry-handle-generation.md` |
| 169 | **M169** — nothing else writes the handle, and the use path doesn't just compare: it traps | `docs/log/M169-handle-writers-and-the-trap.md` |
| 170 | **M170** — `trap(0)` is `break`, and the exception path never returns | `docs/log/M170-break-halts.md` |
| 171 | **M171** — where it stops, and why nothing software can do will restart it | `docs/log/M171-where-it-stops.md` |
| 172 | **M172** — *(no row, no note)* | commit only: `cc1673b` “M172: drop a citation to a file the repo does not have”, `c26d44a` “M172: consolidate for a rebuild — the format header, its C validator, and the start-here doc” |
| 173 | **M173** — `obj+5` is not bounded below 14, and 14 turns out not to be the bound | `docs/log/M173-obj-plus-5-is-not-bounded.md` |
| 174 | **M174** — the runner CI that never ran, the suite that would have gone red, and the two mistakes I made finding them | `docs/log/M174-the-ci-that-never-ran.md` |
| 175 | **M175** — the self-hosted tier: all 230 cases in CI without uploading the cartridge | `docs/log/M175-the-self-hosted-tier.md` |

| 256 | **M256** — the permuter plateaued at 1 900; the fix it could not find was one operand order | `docs/log/M256-the-permuter-plateau-and-the-operand-that-moved.md` |

| 263 | **M263** — `-mcpu=r4300`: p7 is byte-exact, and the "unreachable" residues were a build flag | `docs/log/M263-mcpu-r4300-p7-byte-exact.md` |
| 264 | **M264** — re-read under the r4300 cost model: p6 is byte-exact too, and p8's last difference is a placement | `docs/log/M264-reread-p6-exact-p8-is-a-placement.md` |
| 265 | **M265** — both patches together: the pool lands where the image's does, and p8's residue changes kind | `docs/log/M265-both-patches-the-pool-lands-where-the-images-does.md` |

| 277 | **M277** — `0x8007e590`, second pass: every region now the right size, the default arm exact, and two errors that were reading, not reconstruction | `docs/log/M277-0x8007e590-regions-sized-and-two-found-by-wrong-address.md` |
| 278 | **M278** — `0x8007e590` at 226 of 229: the copy block, both table reads, and a switch with no `default` | `docs/log/M278-0x8007e590-226-of-229-transposition-and-exit-kind.md` |

| 303 | **M303** — `osCreateThread` under the permuter: a negative result, the shape/allocation boundary, and an inert setting | `docs/log/M303-oscreatethread-under-the-permuter.md` |
| 304 | **M304** — the case-4 select register, decoded: 32 spellings that change nothing | `docs/log/M304-the-case-4-select-register-decoded.md` |
| 305 | **M305** — the select-shape census: the preference is systematic, but the obstacle is a conflict, so the patch is a different one | `docs/log/M305-the-select-shape-census.md` |
| 306 | **M306** — the second `cc1`: the fill cannot move ahead of `global_alloc`, and two variants that do not move the register | `docs/log/M306-the-second-cc1-experiments.md` |
| 307 | **M307** — the duplicate-body cohorts: 48 functions byte-exact from three reconstructions | `docs/log/M307-the-duplicate-body-cohorts.md` |
| 308 | **M308** — the small tail of the duplicate census: 11 more functions, and the 25-word group stuck at 22/25 | `docs/log/M308-the-small-tail-of-the-duplicate-census.md` |
| 309 | **M309** — instrumenting `reorg.c`: the scheduler was not the culprit, and the trace says so | `docs/log/M309-instrumenting-reorg.md` |
| 310 | **M310** — the copy that forces the annul: `u16` truncation, proven by removing it | `docs/log/M310-the-truncation-copy.md` |
| 311 | **M311** — REG_TRACE: it is a tie-break, so the duplicates are next — and a defect in M309's patch | `docs/log/M311-regtrace-it-is-a-tie-break.md` |
| 312 | **M312** — the duplicate census, vetted: 85 candidates, and two things I had wrong | `docs/log/M312-the-duplicate-census-vetted.md` |
| 313 | **M313** — the 4 x 53 group: decoded, drafted, and stopped at 33/53 by the same wall | `docs/log/M313-the-4x53-group.md` |
| 314 | **M314** — the 3 x 32 group: two drafts, 29/32, stopped at the cap | `docs/log/M314-the-3x32-group-two-drafts.md` |
| 315 | **M315** — the first singles batch: three of ten, one draft each | `docs/log/M315-the-first-singles-batch.md` |
| 316 | **M316** — the leaf screen: 16 of 16, and a reusable selector | `docs/log/M316-the-leaf-screen.md` |
| 317 | **M317** — the 4-word set: 9 of 17, and four of the misses were one known residue | `docs/log/M317-the-four-word-set.md` |
| 318 | **M318** — `volatile` answered, and the 5-word sample: 6 of 8 | `docs/log/M318-volatile-answered-and-the-5-word-sample.md` |
| 319 | **M319** — the leaf screen, a toolchain defect it exposed, and 20 functions from the 6-8 word pool | `docs/log/M319-the-leaf-screen-and-the-6-8-word-pool.md` |
| 320 | **M320** — the 4-word misses and the tail: five truncated extents, no new functions | `docs/log/M320-the-4-word-misses-and-the-tail.md` |
| 321 | **M321** — `0x8004276c` cannot be written in C, and the test that proves it | `docs/log/M321-the-46-word-transform-is-not-c.md` |
| 322 | **M322** — `main` at 0x80000520: 30 of 30, and a retraction the root view earned | `docs/log/M322-main-at-0x80000520.md` |
| 323 | **M323** — the two boot roots and the boot edge: two negations and one settled boundary | `docs/log/M323-the-two-boot-roots-and-the-boot-edge.md` |
| 324 | **M324** — the boot extent corrected: 0x11140 → 0x13420, and the function it unlocked | `docs/log/M324-the-boot-extent-correction.md` |

## The gaps, and why they are empty

**56** milestone numbers have neither a row in `docs/reverse_engineering_log.md` nor a note in `docs/log/`. The project did not keep a note for every number it used: much of the middle work was recorded in `docs/format_notes.md` and in commit messages instead, and the log's own numbering runs M10–M30 in that style before resuming per-milestone notes at M81.

* **M48, M51, M78, M172, M240, M241, M242, M243** survive only as commit subjects, quoted above. Nothing further is known about them, so nothing further is written.
* **24, 31–47, 49–50, 52–77, 80, 244** have no evidence in the tree at all — no row, no note, no commit that names them.

None of these gaps is reconstructed after the fact. A note written from guesswork would be indistinguishable from a note written from measurement, and this project's whole claim is that the difference is visible.
