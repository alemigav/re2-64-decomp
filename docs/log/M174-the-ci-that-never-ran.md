# M174 — the runner CI that never ran, the suite that would have gone red, and the two mistakes I made finding them

The ask was "add a CI workflow that runs the test suite on every push". The repo already had one — since
M128 — and it had **never been scheduled a single time**, for two independent reasons. This note records
the repair, the two defects that repair uncovered, and the two things I got wrong on the way.

## 1. The workflow was invalid YAML, so GitHub never accepted it

`.github/workflows/acceptance.yml` carried this line:

```yaml
      - name: Report what CI can and cannot see
        run: printf 'ROM present: %s\n' "$(test -f 'rom/…' && echo yes || echo no)"
```

`run:` takes a **plain scalar** here, and a plain scalar cannot contain `: `. Every YAML parser rejects the
file at that line — `psych` reports *"mapping values are not allowed in this context at line 32 column 33"*.
GitHub answers such a push with **"Invalid workflow file"** and schedules nothing, so the workflow's own
header claims ("51 of the 54 cases") were never exercised, and M130's rewrite of the same header inherited
the claim. A file whose only reader is a remote service is **unverified** until something local parses it;
that is the whole finding, one line of YAML wide.

Fixed with a block scalar. The file now parses (`ruby -ryaml`, 5 steps, `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`,
`timeout-minutes: 20`), and got `permissions: contents: read`, a `concurrency` group, and a pinned
interpreter (`3.9`, the one the suites are verified on) rather than a floating `3.x`.

## 2. The suite labelled "synthetic" was not cartridge-free, so the first push would have been red

`tools/acceptance.py` marked `synthetic-rdram walk` as `needs_cart=False`. It runs
`tools/rdram_fixture.py`, which builds its memory synthetically but then **shells out to `walk_stream.py`,
which loads `assets/unpacked/00000_0014420_1172240.bin`** — an unpacked cartridge member:

```
FileNotFoundError: … 'assets/unpacked/00000_0014420_1172240.bin'
0/7 synthetic-rdram walk case(s)
```

Green locally, red on any fresh clone. It is measured, not argued: a tracked-files-only tree
(`git archive HEAD | tar -x`) reproduces the runner exactly, and before the fix `sh tools/ci.sh` there
ended `ci: FAILED`. The flag is now `True`, so the suite reports SKIP like the other cartridge suites.

That measurement also replaced every estimated number in the CI prose — locally and on a runner:

| where | suites | cases |
|---|---|---|
| local, cartridge present | **21 / 21** | **228 / 228** |
| runner, no cartridge | **10 / 21 run** | **125 / 228**, 11 suites / 103 cases SKIP |

Both figures are asserted by `tools/acceptance.py`'s expected counts, so the prose goes stale loudly. The
job summary now prints the split too, because a green run that silently skipped 11 suites is a misleading
green.

## 3. CI cannot test the file that makes CI run — so `tools/workflow_lint.py` does

This is the general form of §1: an invalid workflow is *never scheduled*, so the failure has no reporter.
The new suite needs no cartridge, which means **a runner checks its own definition on the next push**:

| case | what it stops |
|---|---|
| `name`/`on`/`jobs` at column 0 | a file that is not a workflow |
| no plain scalar contains `': '` | **the exact defect above** |
| every `uses:` pins a ref | a floating `@main` that changes under you |
| `runs-on` and `timeout-minutes` | a job that can hold the slot for hours |
| a step runs `tools/ci.sh` or `tools/acceptance.py` | a workflow that proves nothing |
| `permissions: contents: read` | a token wider than its job |

Five synthetic fixtures prove the linter can fail, one of them a verbatim copy of the broken line. It is a
gate, so it is audited: `audit_gates.py` is now **20/20, 0 vacuous**.

## 4. Two mistakes of mine, recorded rather than tidied away

1. **I wrote a duplicate workflow.** Asked for "a CI workflow", I wrote `.github/workflows/ci.yml` without
   looking — and my earlier `ls` of the repo root had hidden `.github`, because it is a dotfile. The
   workflow has existed since M128. I deleted mine. The mistake is worth more than an apology: the check
   is `git ls-files .github` or `find .github -type f`, not `ls`.
2. **My first audit of the new linter was vacuous.** `audit_gates.py` builds a throw-away environment from
   `tools/`, `fixtures/`, `docs/log/` — **not** `.github/` — so the mutated linter failed on a *missing
   directory*, not on its mutation. The detail line in the audit output gave it away
   (`FAIL the repository has at least one workflow — .github/workflows is empty`). `.github` is copied in
   now, and the audit fails for the right reason (`FAIL the line that was actually broken is caught`). This
   is the third time this arc that an audit environment omitted a dependency — `build/elfs` and `src` were
   the first two.

## 5. What a green run still does not cover

The 11 skipped suites are the ones that assert facts about RE2 itself: the corpus checks, the script VM,
the model container, the T64 texture law, the exception path, the routine-index bounds (M173). They run
wherever the cartridge exists — locally, and in the pre-commit hook — and M130's ROM-as-secret route stays
deliberately unadopted. **A green CI run does not vouch for those 103 cases**, and the handover now says so
with the measured numbers instead of the old `51 of 54`.

## 6. Addendum: the sanctioned edit path was dropping file modes

Committing this milestone turned up a defect in the tool every edit in this repo goes through.
`tools/patch_text.py` writes each file by writing a **new** temporary file and calling `replace()` — which
installs a *new inode*, so the original's mode goes with the old one. The commit recorded it plainly:

```
mode change 100755 => 100644 tools/ci.sh
```

Harmless for `ci.sh` (always run as `sh tools/ci.sh`), and **not** harmless for `tools/pre-commit.sh`,
which the hook executes directly: one patch to it and the commit hook silently stops running. The fix is
one line (`shutil.copymode`), the self-test grew a case that patches an executable file and requires the
bit to survive (**8/8**), and that case is audited — removing the `copymode` call fails it, so
`audit_gates.py` is now **20/20, 0 vacuous**.

The general form is worth keeping: *a tool that rewrites a file is responsible for everything about the
file that is not its text.*

```
python3 tools/workflow_lint.py        # 11/11 — CI checking its own definition
python3 tools/acceptance.py           # 21 suites, 228 cases
python3 tools/audit_gates.py          # 20/20, 0 vacuous
sh tools/ci.sh                        # ci: ok
```
